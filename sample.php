                Welcome to Precious Passage Birth Services. 
                I specialize in direct-entry midwifery and doula 
                services, particularly in the home setting. I service 
                the Cleveland, Akron, and Canton area of Ohio. 
                As a midwife and doula I strives to give you the 
                gift of a birth experience you will want to remember.

                <p>
                    To date, I have had five children.&nbsp; 
                    The first in the hospital, the other four at home.&nbsp; 
                    After experiencing both, I really prefer homebirthing. I support 
                    women regardless of their choice of birthplace; in fact, couples 
                    birthing in a hospital need an advocate more than couples birthing at 
                    home.&nbsp; Homebirth is not the right choice for every couple, but 
                    it is a viable alternative for any low risk mother.&nbsp; As a DEM, 
                    I strongly suggest that any couple hoping to achieve a drug and 
                    intervention free birth consider homebirthing.&nbsp; Here are a 
                    few of the advantages to having your baby at home.&nbsp; </font>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Birth is perceived as a normal physiologic event, not a medical
                            procedure or emergency.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Complete control over birth environment (noise level, lighting,
                            number of people present) which leads to increased feeling of 
                            safety and ability to cope with labor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Freedom to labor the way you want to.&nbsp; Women feel much 
                            less inhibited in the privacy of their home.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Increased bonding with baby, partner and other children.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Formation of a relationship with midwife and doula which 
                            enhances the birth experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduced chance of intervention by care provider.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No temptation to take pain relieving drugs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No interruption of labor by a trip to the hospital.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No routine medical procedures done to baby.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Strong support of breastfeeding and immediate contact 
                            between mom and baby. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
