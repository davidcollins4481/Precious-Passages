                    Hypnobabies founder Kerry Tuschhoff's mission statement is simple, 
                    "To help every expectant mother have the safest and most comfortable 
                    childbirth experience".  Finding very little in the way of instructional 
                    hypnosis for childbirth, Kerry created the Hypnobabies program.  
                    Her website is 
                    <a href="" target="_blank">www.Hypnobabies.com</a> .  
                    On the site you can purchase the Hypnobabies home study course for $139. 
                </p>

					Kerry has written,
					<a href="">Hypnosis for Childbirth</a> , 
					an article concisely explaining Hypnobabies and why she feels it is the 
					best hypnosis program for childbirth.
