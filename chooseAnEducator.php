                    Perhaps the most important decision you will make after 
                    choosing your midwife or doctor and the place of birth 
                    is selecting your childbirth educator. She will almost 
                    certainly be your primary source of information on how 
                    to cope with labor. She can -- and should -- help you have 
                    a healthy pregnancy and complication-free labor, make 
                    informed choices about your care, have a smooth transition 
                    into parenthood, and breastfeed successfully. Childbirth 
                    educators can also guide you to other resources such as 
                    books and Web sites and can refer you to childbirth-related 
                    services, as, for example, labor support providers (labor doulas), 
                    postpartum home help (postpartum doulas), or lactation consultants. 
                    You can see why you want to consider carefully whom you choose.

					What should you look for in childbirth preparation classes?
					<ul>
						<li>
							Independent educator: Most commonly, childbirth preparation 
							classes are taught through hospitals, but hospital or 
							clinic-based classes have a strong potential drawback: 
							conflict of interest. It is in the hospital’s and obstetric 
							staff’s interests to have patients who will comply with 
							policies and not make waves by questioning or refusing them. 
							Unfortunately, medical research has shown many aspects of 
							typical, routine obstetric management to be neither safe nor 
							effective. Hospitals may give their educators complete freedom 
							to teach as the educator sees fit, or they may not, in which case, 
							you won’t learn about these. As the authors of “A Good Birth, 
							A Safe Birth” observe, “If you don’t know your options, you don’t 
							have any.” You may also not get an objective picture of pain 
							relief during labor. Labor epidurals generate significant revenue 
							and subsidize having obstetric anesthesiologists available 24/7 to 
							deal with the rare emergency. Hospital-based educators are often 
							told not to discuss the potential problems with epidurals. You may 
							decide for yourself that the benefits of an epidural outweigh the 
							possible problems, but you should have the opportunity to make an 
							informed decision.
						</li>
						<li>
							Certified educator: Certification by a national organization 
							doesn’t guarantee excellence, but it does ensure that the educator 
							has had special training and has met some set of criteria for 
							knowledge and skills. Many hospitals simply have their nurses 
							teach classes, but having a nursing degree does not qualify you 
							in and of itself to teach childbirth preparation classes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sufficient time to cover the topics: Fewer classes in the series 
							and fewer hours per class both increases profits and meets the 
							approval of busy, tired, expectant couples. However, it takes time
							to learn new skills, get questions answered, and explore issues. 
							Lamaze International recommends at least twelve instructional hours 
							per series. Based on my experience as a certified Lamaze teacher, 
							I think 15 hours is the minimum for a thorough, first-birth, 
							childbirth preparation series.
						</li>
						<li>
							Small classes: Childbirth classes should be interactive. You want 
							classes that are big enough for a good group process yet small 
							enough for you to get individual attention and assistance and where 
							you won’t feel shy speaking on intimate or sensitive topics. Lamaze 
							International says that six to ten couples is ideal and sets a 
							maximum of twelve couples.
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					What are some methods of childbirth education?
					<ul>
						<li>
							Lamaze: Because “Lamaze” has become a generic term for childbirth 
							preparation classes, it is important to make sure that a “Lamaze” 
							class is, in fact, taught by a teacher certified by Lamaze 
							International. The Lamaze mission is “to promote normal, natural,
							healthy and fulfilling childbirth experiences for women and their 
							families through education, advocacy and reform.” Lamaze has 
							become known for the “breathing,” but focusing on the breath and 
							using breathing patterns is only one of many tools for coping 
							with labor that is taught in Lamaze classes. In addition to 
							relaxation and comfort measures, Lamaze classes cover normal 
							labor and birth, labor and birth options, strategies to facilitate 
							good progress, and communications skills. They provide information 
							on medical procedures and pain medications to help couples make 
							informed choices. Most educators also cover breastfeeding, 
							postpartum and newborn issues, and adjusting to parenthood. 
							While Lamaze is known almost exclusively for preparation for 
							hospital birth, the Lamaze philosophy of birth explicitly supports 
							birth in birth centers and homes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bradley Method of Natural Childbirth: Among other things, Bradley 
							classes focus on good pregnancy nutrition, natural childbirth, the 
							husband as labor coach, no separation of healthy babies from 
							mothers, and breastfeeding. Women are taught to cope with labor 
							by relaxation, natural breathing, and tuning in to the body. 
							Bradley classes encourage parents to take responsibility for 
							decisions and advocate consumerism and positive communications, 
							as well as being prepared for the unexpected, such as emergency 
							childbirth and cesarean section. The series consists of twelve 
							classes, the first few taken in early pregnancy followed by birth 
							preparation classes beginning in the sixth month.
						</li>
						<li>
							International Childbirth Education Association (ICEA): ICEA’s 
							motto is “Freedom of choice based on knowledge of alternatives,” 
							and its philosophy is based on the principles of family-centered 
							maternity care. Family-centered maternity care is care that 
							achieves the best possible health outcomes for all family members. 
							Family-centered maternity care treats childbirth as a life event, 
							not a medical procedure. It recognizes the importance of family 
							relationships and respects the woman’s individuality and autonomy. 
							The goal of ICEA’s certification program is to produce educators 
							who have the necessary knowledge and skills to help expectant 
							couples prepare mentally and physically for childbirth. ICEA 
							educators advocate for the natural process of childbirth and the 
							right of parents to make informed choices about their care.
						</li>
						<li>
							BirthWorks: BirthWorks begins with the premise that women need 
							to develop confidence in their ability to give birth and to allow 
							themselves to be guided by that inner knowledge. There is no 
							“right” way to give birth; each birth experience is unique. 
							BirthWorks believes that while cesarean sections are necessary 
							at times, the current rate is too high and that vaginal birth 
							after cesarean is preferable to planned repeat cesarean in most 
							cases. BirthWorks classes encourage women to choose a place of 
							birth in which they will feel secure, which may be the home or 
							a birth center. BirthWorks also encourages women to participate 
							actively in decisions made about their care. BirthWorks classes 
							begin preferably in early pregnancy or may be started even before 
							pregnancy. This is so that women can become aware of beliefs that 
							influence decisions about caregiver and birth place, learn how to 
							communicate effectively with caregivers, and learn about good 
							nutrition in pregnancy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Association of Childbirth Educators and Labor Assistants (ALACE): 
							ALACE "seeks to help all women experience birth’s transforming 
							power with dignity, in safety, support, and confidence." To that 
							end, ALACE educators work to increase trust in the natural birth
							 process and teach students how to cope with the pain of labor. 
							 They also provide the information needed to make informed choices 
							 and avoid unnecessary interventions, in particular, cesarean 
							 section. ALACE educators prepare women for birth at home and in 
							 birth centers, as well as hospitals.
						</li>
						<li>
							Birthing from Within: "The profound mystery and spirituality of 
							birth can never be understood with the mind; they are known 
							through the heart." This statement from the Birthing from Within 
							Web site sums up their approach: Birthing from Within instructors 
							are called "mentors," not "instructors" or "educators," to 
							emphasize that women don’t need teaching so much as they need the 
							opportunity to discover their own strengths and wisdom. Birthing 
							from Within classes include practical information, but they also 
							use multisensory exercises -- art, singing lullabies -- and 
							introspection to explore personal and cultural beliefs about labor 
							and labor pain. Pam England and Rob Horowitz’s book of the same 
							title is a wonderful resource on its own as well as an introduction 
							to this childbirth preparation method.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Note: Many childbirth instructors incorporate concepts, techniques, and 
					strategies from various methods, including from disciplines not strictly 
					related to childbirth such as acupressure, hypnosis, or communications 
					skills.
                </p>
                <p>
					What questions should you ask a prospective educator? <br/>
					The qualities of the individual educator, and the fit between her 
					philosophy and style and yours, matters far more than which school of 
					childbirth preparation she trained in. For this reason, it is best to 
					interview her before signing up. With hospital-based classes, or in other 
					situations where you don’t contact the teacher directly, you have a couple 
					of options. The intermediary person can give you an email address or 
					telephone number. If the policy is not to give out telephone numbers, 
					leave yours and ask that the educator call you.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Are you certified by a national organization? Which one? What is 
							your background and training specific to childbirth education?
						</li>
						<li>
							What topics does the class cover?
						</li>
						<li>
							What are your overall goals for your students?
						</li>
						<li>
							What is your opinion of ______ (or) how do you feel about _____? 
							(Insert anything about which you have a strong opinion.)
						</li>
						<li>
							What is your approach to teaching about pain relief medications?
						</li>
						<li>
							Do you attend births? Working with laboring women will almost 
							always make class content more practical and relevant. You may 
							also wish to hire your instructor as a doula (trained labor 
							support person).
						</li>
