                    It is my goal to provide continuous, high quality support to my 
                    clients in the atmosphere of their choice.    We can labor at home 
                    as long as you like, or meet at the hospital.  While there are 
                    certain restrictions regarding doulas and out of hospital birth, 
                    because I am also a midwife, I will provide  homebirth labor support.   
                    My service area includes but is not limited to the 
                    Cleveland/Akron/Canton area of Ohio.
                </p>

					Many couples feel they cannot afford a doula.  However, if you have 
					an insurance co-pay [say an 80/20 plan], you will probably save more 
					by having a doula present than your doula charges. Remember that 
					labor is shorter, there are fewer interventions [continuous external 
					or internal fetal monitoring, induction, Pitocin, vacuum or forceps 
					delivery, epidural, narcotics], the cesarean rate is much lower and 
					the epidural rate is much lower.  So, if you add up even 20% of the 
					cost of these interventions, a doula actually saves you money. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
					My  fee for doula services is $800.  Because I believe that every 
					woman deserves a doula, I am willing to negotiate if you cannot 
					afford my fee. Also, as of October 1, 2009, doula fees are 
					reimbursable by some insurance companies.
                </p>

					 It is entirely possible to have the birth experience you want and 
					 deserve.   Much  research has shown that when women and their 
					 partners are provided with continuous, compassionate support, 
					 they recall the birth experience with greater satisfaction and 
					 bond to their infants sooner, even if the experience they had 
					 wasn't what they would describe as "ideal".  My goal is to give 
					 you the gift of a birth experience you will WANT to remember.
