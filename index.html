				<p>
					To date, I have had five children.&nbsp; 
					The first in the hospital, the other four at home.&nbsp; 
					After experiencing both, I really prefer homebirthing. I support 
					women regardless of their choice of birthplace; in fact, couples 
					birthing in a hospital need an advocate more than couples birthing at 
					home.&nbsp; Homebirth is not the right choice for every couple, but 
					it is a viable alternative for any low risk mother.&nbsp; As a DEM, 
					I strongly suggest that any couple hoping to achieve a drug and 
					intervention free birth consider homebirthing.&nbsp; Here are a 
					few of the advantages to having your baby at home.&nbsp; </font>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Birth is perceived as a normal physiologic event, not a medical
							procedure or emergency.
						</li>
						<li>
							Complete control over birth environment (noise level, lighting,
							number of people present) which leads to increased feeling of 
							safety and ability to cope with labor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Freedom to labor the way you want to.&nbsp; Women feel much 
							less inhibited in the privacy of their home.
						</li>
						<li>
							Increased bonding with baby, partner and other children.
						</li>
						<li>
							Formation of a relationship with midwife and doula which 
							enhances the birth experience.
						</li>
						<li>
							Reduced chance of intervention by care provider.
						</li>
						<li>
							No temptation to take pain relieving drugs.
						</li>
						<li>
							No interruption of labor by a trip to the hospital.
						</li>
						<li>
							No routine medical procedures done to baby.
						</li>
						<li>
							Strong support of breastfeeding and immediate contact 
							between mom and baby. 
						</li>
					</ul>
