                    The reason for creating a birth plan is so that everyone understands your hopes
                    and desires for labor and birth. It is a great place to begin discussions with
                    your caregiver(s). This is <i>not</i> a contract, but a statement of your
                    preferences. (<a style="color: #324094; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="http://PregnancyAndBaby.com/inside/look/26.htm"><span style="color: windowtext">Click
                    here</span></a> for a great article about birth plans.) </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: windowtext">Birth plans are best kept
                    short and to the point -- lots of details may be lost on medical support staff.
                    You may wish to create two plans: one for you and your support team (coach,
                    doula, etc.) and another, more concise document (about a page long) for your
                    caregiver and the hospital/birth center staff. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: windowtext">It is <i>very important</i>
                    that you talk about the procedures and/or choices that appear your plan with
                    your caregiver(s). Not only do obstetric practices often vary by caregiver,
                    hospital, state and country, there are often important factors involved. It is
                    your responsibility to evaluate and understand each choice you make. </span></p>

                    On the plan below, all section headings are checked by default. If you do not
                    select any of the options underneath a particular heading (and keep the blank
                    boxes clear), uncheck the heading box in order to avoid having a spare heading
                    with no additional text. </span></p>

                    the &quot;create&quot; button at the end of the page! Save the finished plan to your hard
                    drive as a .htm or .html file or print it out. </span></p>
