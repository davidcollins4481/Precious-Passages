                    Birthing From Within; was conceived and developed by a midwife after giving 
                    birth by cesarean. Before her cesarean, Pam England believed women could 
                    avoid cesareans and other interventions by arming themselves with 
                    information, a positive attitude and a birth plan. While on the operating 
                    table, she mused over the irony that although she knew more about birth 
                    than any of the women in her family, living or dead, she was the first 
                    woman in her family to have a cesarean!
                </p>
                <p>
					During the cesarean, Pam's life changed when her entire being was filled 
					with these questions: What did I need to know to give birth as a mother 
					that I didn't know as a midwife?, What do modern women need to know to give 
					birth-in-awareness in a medicalized birth culture?
                </p>
                <p>
					Over many years of testing her vision on parents in her childbirth classes 
					in Albuquerque, midwife Pam England created and refined the innovative, 
					multi-sensory Birthing From Within approach to childbirth preparation.
                </p>
                <p>
					Experienced and aspiring Childbirth Teachers, Doulas, Nurses, Midwives, 
					Mothers and Therapists all over the United States, Canada, Ireland and 
					other countries are enthusiastic about the dynamic, life-changing Birthing 
					From Within Mentor Training and Certification Program. They are taking an 
					active part in creating a paradigm shift in the way parents and 
					professionals prepare for and experience birth. They invite you to join in

						<li>
							Childbirth is a profound rite of passage, not a medical event 
							(even when medical care is part of the birth).
						</li>
						<li>
							The essence of childbirth preparation is self-discovery, not 
							assimilating obstetric information.
						</li>
						<li>
							The teacher (mentor) is "midwife" to the parents' discovery 
							process, not the expert from whom wisdom flows.
						</li>
						<li>
							Childbirth preparation is a continually evolving process (for 
							parents and teachers), not a static structure of techniques and 
							knowledge.
						</li>
						<li>
							Parents' individual needs and differences determine class content.
						</li>
						<li>
							Active, creative self-expression is critical to childbirth 
							preparation.
						</li>
						<li>
							The purpose of childbirth preparation is to prepare mothers to 
							give birth-in-awareness, not to achieve a specific birth outcome.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pregnancy and birth outcome are influenced by a variety of factors, 
							but can't be controlled by planning.
						</li>
						<li>
							In order to help parents mobilize their coping resources, it is 
							critical for childbirth classes to acknowledge that unexpected, 
							unwelcome events may happen during labor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Parents deserve support for any birth option which might be right 
							for them (whether it be drugs, technology, home birth, or 
							bottle-feeding).
						</li>
						<li>
							Pain is an inevitable part of childbirth, yet much can be done to 
							ease suffering.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pain coping practices work best when integrated into daily life, 
							rather than "dusted off" for labor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Father help best as birth guardians or loving partners, not as 
							coaches; they also need support.
						</li>
						<li>
							For parents, pregnancy, birth, and postpartum is a time of 
							continuous learning and adjustment; holistic support and education 
							should be available throughout that period.
						</li>
						<li>
							Childbirth preparation is also parent preparation.
