                            1. What is The Bradley Method&reg;?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The Bradley Method&reg; teaches natural childbirth and views birth 
                            as a natural process. It is our belief that most women with proper 
                            education, preparation, and the help of a loving and supportive 
                            coach can be taught to give birth naturally. The Bradley Method&reg; 
                            is a system of natural labor techniques in which a woman and her 
                            coach play an active part. It is a simple method of increasing 
                            self-awareness, teaching a woman how to deal with the stress of 
                            labor by tuning in to her own body. The Bradley Method&reg; encourages 
                            mothers to trust their bodies using natural breathing, relaxation, 
                            nutrition, exercise, and education.

                            2. How is The Bradley Method&reg; Unique?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            1. The Bradley Method&reg; teaches couples ways to stay low risk. While 
                            occasionally there are risk factors out of your control, staying 
                            healthy and low risk can help to avoid complications. Low risk 
                            mothers have more choices.

                        <dd>
                            2. Relaxation is the Key to The Bradley Method&reg; during labor. It 
                            is the safest and most effective way to reduce unnecessary pain and 
                            to handle any pain that you do experience. While other methods seek 
                            to control the sensations of labor (emphasizing distraction as their 
                            Primary labor control technique), The Bradley Method&reg; encourages 
                            mothers to trust their bodies (emphasizing relaxed abdominal 
                            breathing and relaxation throughout labor).

                            3. The term Bradley&reg; is a registered trademark to ensure you are 
                            getting quality childbirth education. All Bradley&reg; instructors are 
                            highly trained to help you learn how to give birth.

                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The kind of pregnancy, labor, and birth our children experience has 
                            a profound and lifelong effect on their health, including their 
                            mental, emotional, and physical health. The Bradley Method&reg; attempts 
                            to give babies the best possible start in life by teaching how to 
                            have a natural pregnancy and a natural childbirth.

                            Healthy nutrition, appropriate exercise, and pregnancy information 
                            can be of benefit throughout the entire pregnancy. For most 
                            couples, the fifth month is the suggested time to begin a Bradley&reg; 
                            class series as they seriously start training for labor and for 
                            their upcoming role as parents. The earlier you start, the better 
                            prepared you'll be physically, emotionally, and mentally. In many 
                            areas, early pregnancy classes are also offered.

                        Meet Your Bradley&reg; Teacher
                    </h3>
                    Your Bradley&reg; teacher is a health professional who has completed a 
                    comprehensive teacher training program through the American Academy 
                    of Husband Coached Childbirth&reg; (AAHCC). The three part training program 
                    consists of academic studies, teacher training workshop, and student 
                    teaching. The training program can be completed in one year although 
                    the length varies based on each candidate's personal schedule.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The academic portion consists of reading and reporting on books related 
                    to prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods, observing another 
                    teacher's classes, attending La Leche League meetings, visiting and 
                    completing a survey of two area hospitals, and making a personal referral 
                    file of other childbirth services available in the community.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The teacher training workshop lasts four days and all necessary topics are 
                    covered by speakers, videotapes, and hands-on learning.
                    <br/><br/>
                    During the student teaching, each provisional affiliate returns his or her 
                    weekly class outline and teacher evaluation form to the AAHCC. The 
                    provisional affiliate's students submit nutrition forms and a teacher 
                    evaluation form at the end of the series. Final certification is granted 
                    after the provisional affiliate satisfactorily completes a comprehensive 
                    final examination.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Continuing education is required annually of all affiliated Bradley&reg; 
                    childbirth educators. Academic requirements, such as reading a new book 
                    related to childbirth education, birth observations, attending a La Leche 
                    League meeting, observing another teacher, and supporting local AAHCC 
                    activities are required before renewal is granted. All teachers must also 
                    sign a Statement of Policy agreeing to teach only the principles of the 
                    Bradley Method&reg;.

                        Opinions From The Net
                    </h3>
                    Here's what I posted to the net, and the responses...
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you have used the Bradley Method for a birth, please send
                    me your experiences for future net.readers!  I want this even if
                    you HATED the method, or threw parts right out the window in
                    labor!  I want to present a balanced view if I can - I know 
                    it is impossible for me to be unbiased since I teach the method!
                    <br/><br/>
                    (From another Bradley teacher) Well, teacher biases aside, I hope, here 
                    is what I like and dislike about the Bradley Method and how it worked for 
                    me with my birth:
                    <br/><br/>
                    Baby #1 - took hospital classes, liked them. I was at a slight risk for 
                    having a cesarean because of questionable history of herpes simplex type 2, 
                    so also took the cesarean prep class at the hospital. Prior to this class, 
                    I was TERRIFIED of the idea of having a cesarean. I am really glad, in 
                    retrospect, that I took this class. Although I did not need a cesarean, 
                    taking this class removed this fear for me. I left the class thinking that 
                    I could endure a cesarean, if I needed to. This helped eliminate lots of 
                    the fear I had prior to my labor and birth. The birth was straight-forward, 
                    a "normal" hospital birth. I recieved two injections of pain medication,
                    pushed two hours, with internal monitor after the first hour was up, 
                    recieved a pudendal block and the doctor used a vacuum extractor to remove 
                    my baby. I had an episiotomy that extended into a third degree tear. My 
                    baby didn't nurse for 9 days following the birth. I have had problems with 
                    that darn tear ever since, and baby is now 9 (years!)
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Note: In the years following this birth, the negative emotions I had 
                    about this birth and the anger at that dr. who cut my perinium have faded, 
                    I remember this birth now as one of the two most special and wonderful 
                    events of my life - I'm really very much at peace with how it went.)
                    <br/><br/>
                    My questions after the birth: Did the pain medication or the vacuum extractor 
                    affect my baby's ability to nurse?
                    <br/><br/>
                    It never occured to me to ask for pain medication during this labor - I 
                    took it on the recommendation of the labor nurse, had I not asked, would 
                    I have needed pain medication?
                    <br/><br/>
                    I did not feel at all fatigued during the pushing stage, could I have 
                    pushed the baby out without the vacuum extractor given more time?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Would giving birth not flat on my back have prevented the episiotomy from 
                    extending?
                    <br/><br/>
                    Did the hospital classes prepare me to be a good patient? The message I 
                    got in class was "don't be afraid to use medication, most women need it."
                    <br/><br/>
                    Prework for baby #2: Read the book "Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way", 
                    found an instructor.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Enjoyed about the Bradley class: My teacher was very open and friendly. 
                    My husband was able to understand and accept things better from our 
                    instructor, at times, than he was from me. (She was "the expert" after 
                    all, and I was just his wife. Says alot about our relationship, I know, 
                    but that's a whole other issue.) He finally got the picture that I wasn't 
                    OK with how the first birth had gone, why I wanted to make some changes 
                    this time around. The class was small, 5 couples, instead of the 50+ in 
                    the hospital class. We got lots more technical information, practical 
                    relaxation exercises, videos, than we had in the hospital class (and that 
                    was with the old workbook, even!). Wrote our birth plan. We recieved the 
                    message that, properly supported, most women can give birth naturally. 
                    Good preparation for complications, too.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Found lacking in the Bradley class we took: Attention to some of the 
                    emotional aspects of birth. A little over-preachy about the dangers of 
                    ultrasound. I.E., they were presented as dangerous rather than unknowns.
                    <br/><br/>
                    How the Bradley class prepared us for birth: Birth #2 was, in total, an 
                    hour longer than birth #1. Arrived at hospital after 5 hours of labor at 
                    2 cm. Nurse-midwife on duty said "You're not even in active labor yet, 
                    this baby is obviously much bigger than the first baby you needed help 
                    in getting out, we may be looking at a cesarean here." She left the room. 
                    My husband and I looked at each other in dismay - after all our careful
                    plans and change to what we thought were supportive caregivers, we didn't 
                    know what to think. Shift change happened and a new labor nurse came in. 
                    Suggested medication to help me sleep, or a bath. (It was 6am.) I choose 
                    a bath, and at 9 was found to be 7 cm. (Not in active labor, yeah, right.)
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is an important lesson I learned from experience that corresponds to 
                    "Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way" - emotional signposts are better at 
                    predicting where you are in labor than cervical dilation. Sure I was 
                    dilated to 2, and the nurse-midwife took dilation to 4 cm as a sign of 
                    active labor. I went to the hospital after I knew I'd been in active labor 
                    for awhile by my emotional signposts, and I was right. It just took a 
                    little while longer for this active labor to make a change in my cervix! 
                    No problem! 
                    <br/><br/>
                    New nurse-midwife after shift change was very supportive. Stayed with me 
                    all though pushing. She chewed out the labor nurse when the labor nurse 
                    suggested medication again, as she recognized that I was doing fine, and 
                    although I was complaining about the pain, that was my way of coping with 
                    it. I pushed for three LONG hours before giving birth to a baby 2 whole 
                    pounds bigger than my first. He nursed very well! I had a big tear, but 
                    it didn't extend.
                    <br/><br/>
                    How the Bradley Method made a difference in the life of my newborn and myself:
                    <br/><br/>
                    About 5 hours after birth, after moving to our room, the floor nurse 
                    wanted to help me bathe my baby, and she noticed that he was breathing 
                    much too quickly and with too much effort. She apologized for calling 
                    the pediatrician in to look at the baby "I know she'll want to bring 
                    the baby to the nursery for observation, and I know you want to keep 
                    the baby here, but I really think she should look at him." Sure enough, 
                    baby goes to the nursery. My husband had gone home with my older child 
                    to take a nap, and I decided to remain in my room and finish my supper, 
                    then take a quick nap (it was now 5 pm and I hadn't slept yet!) before 
                    joining baby in the nursery. I woke up about 7 and went to the bathroom, 
                    where I proceeded to hemorrhage. I became severely anemic as a result. I 
                    think that using the Bradley Method and giving birth naturally had two 
                    quite unexpected results in our postpartum: 1) Baby had fluid in his 
                    lungs, and had a great deal of difficulty breathing for a few days. 
                    He also had a form of pathological jaundice (ABO). I was very glad that 
                    he was able to put all his resources toward healing and didn't have to 
                    metabolize the remainder of any medications. 2) I felt MUCH better 5 days 
                    after this birth than I had 5 weeks after the birth of my first child, 
                    despite the anemia. This gave me the energy to deal with a child in the 
                    level 2 nursery (and one at home!) Oh, yeah, 3) I followed the advice in 
                    the Bradley workbook to take 2-3 rests in bed every day following the 
                    birth. I didn't get to do this till baby was out of the nursery and at 
                    home, but once he was home I did. It made a world of difference in my 
                    energy level and happiness than following my first birth when I was 
                    supermom right away, doing laundry, trying to breastfeed, and wondering 
                    when I'd be able to run marathons again.

                    Can't help here, but I would include somewhere in the FAQ for Bradley 
                    Method or Birth Plans the other independent childbirth preparation 
                    methods: IH/IBP and ICAN's BirthWorks. This may be helpful for someone 
                    who doesn't have a Bradley teacher in their area but may have one of 
                    these other two methods available.

                <p>
                    I have had one "Lamaze" baby and 3 "Bradley" babies. I had a paracervical 
                    with birth #1, though I resisted it to the end; the other three babies 
                    were totally natural, and very fulfilling. The reason I switched: I found 
                    out during my first birth that my body's natural inclinations were to do 
                    what I had read about Bradley --- deep breathing, tuning inside ---- 
                    rather than the externally based Lamaze, which seeks to distract the 
                    mother with outside focal points and different patterns of breathing. 
                    What I got most out of Bradley was a *confidence* in my body's ability to 
                    give birth --- without drugs --- successfully. I withdrew into myself as 
                    the labor progressed, and concentrated on letting go and opening up, 
                    cooperating with the process, allowing it to happen..... I also was able 
                    to communicate to my caregivers and support people when I needed more 
                    privacy in order for all of this to happen. Bradley empowers parents to 
                    take responsibility for their births, rather than hand all of that 
                    responsibility over to a physician.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Nowadays, taking responsibility is probably the ONLY way you can achieve 
                    a natural childbirth. Most Lamaze classes (but not all) are hospital 
                    sponsored and teach what I call "prepared hospital birth". I myself teach 
                    other prenatal classes for a local hospital, and I have sat in meetings 
                    where the content of "Lamaze" classes was altered to suit physician 
                    preferences, such as the "inconvenience" of squatting delivery. The 
                    changes were not for the good of the patient, but for the local doctor's 
                    preferences! Patients are to be encouraged to be cooperative, not 
                    assertive as to their needs and preferences. I realize that there are
                    probably still a few good Lamaze classes out there...... but only 
                    Bradley is a "standardized" product that serves parents, not the medical 
                    establishment. :-)

                    For our first child, we took the lamaze class offered by the hospital. 
                    at the time i thought that it was great! it offered education on the 
                    birthing process, as well as some technics for dealing with the pain.
                    <br/><br/>
                    but when it came to the actual birth, almost none of the info was of any 
                    use. my wife found that the lamaze breathing just didn't work. and there 
                    were complications, for which the lamaze class didn't offer any help.
                    <br/><br/>
                    since then, we've spent the past few years educating ourselves. in 
                    retrospect, i've found the lamaze classes to be a complete waste of time. 
                    they were *really* orienting you towards "being a good patient", and not 
                    being an informed consumer. you simply can't teach all that one should 
                    know in the short timeperiod offered by lamaze!
                    <br/><br/>
                    * [editorial note: this is often true of Hospital classes, but not 
                    necessarily of independant Lamaze classes! Most Lamaze classes are 6 
                    weeks long - some are more or less
                    in contrast, i've found the bradley classes to be great! at first i was 
                    skeptical, but having gone through it, i've found them to be the best 
                    thing on the market. personally, bradley isn't the end all and be all 
                    IMHO; i believe the emphasis should be mother-centered, instead of 
                    "husband-coached". but bradley comes the closest that i'm aware of.
                    <br/><br/>
                    however one educates oneself, one must take in whatever info that one can 
                    find, and adopt it to meet your needs. a birth is as individual as the 
                    person being born!

                    Yes, I have used Bradley and I have mixed feelings about it. I had a 
                    daughter (my first child) vaginally almost two years ago in 1992. My 
                    husband and I took a Bradley class to prepare for the birth very much 
                    over my OB's strenuous objections. She doesn't like Bradley and gives as 
                    her main reason that it is anti-feminist ("Husband-coached"....), but to 
                    be honest, I don't think she really knows that much about it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our instructor was a very nice very well meaning woman certified in 
                    Bradley training and who had taught about 3 "semesters" (about 2 classes 
                    per each "semester") by the time I took her class. She had a 16 year old 
                    daughter who was delivered via c-section when her own labor stalled. She 
                    had attended only one other birth as coach for one of her students. Her 
                    lack of experience was a real problem. She had never experienced a 
                    complete labor herself and had only attended one other. She had never 
                    even pushed during her labor so when we got to that part of the class she 
                    kept saying that we'd know what to do, which wasn't very helpful. I 
                    learned far more about labor from reading the Susan Rose-egg McCutcheon 
                    book than from her class. My husband and other students agreed. (I spoke 
                    to most of the other students outside of the class and we pretty much 
                    agreed about the class, the manual and the teacher.)
                    <br/><br/>
                    I thought the mandatory Bradley workbook was less than useless. Most of 
                    the students chucked theirs in a ceremonial gesture as soon as class was 
                    finished. I held onto mine for awhile until I finally ripped off the front 
                    cover (with the other students names and phone numbers) and tossed the 
                    rest. We couldn't figure out why they didn't use a better book. The videos 
                    shown in class were pretty abysmal, especially the Bradley ones. Many 
                    times I had the impression that since Bradley first formulated his 
                    philosophy and information it was frozen in time and nothing new was 
                    added. For example, the dietary information was ancient.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When I finally did have my daughter, she was completely induced (my water 
                    had broken 24 hours before and I had not even started labor). I was on 
                    pitocin for 2 days, starting 6am on November 4th. I used the Bradley 
                    relaxation as long as I physically could -- I managed to do without any 
                    drugs until 11am the next morning. By that time I was constantly throwing 
                    up and crying. The pain was beyond my control to deal with any more. (Up 
                    until then I was sipping soups and such but I couldn't keep them down.) I 
                    finally requested an epidural. Thank goodness I had researched drugs 
                    because my class didn't cover them at all. After that point I was in much 
                    better shape and could handle the rest of the labor and my daughter was 
                    finally born at 5pm that evening after 3.5 hours of pushing and breaking 
                    almost every blood vessel in my eyes. I can send my full birth story to 
                    anyone who is interested. (shams@perennial.com)
                    <br/><br/>
                    Several months later I learned that one of the students in my class was 
                    becoming an Bradley instructor. This surprised me because, although she 
                    was able to have a natural birth with her son, she had NO other birth 
                    experience. My instructor was a very poor instructor. I don't think this 
                    woman could be much better. I have very little faith in the Bradley 
                    certification system -- they seem to let anyone teach who has the desire 
                    to do so. I would have preferred a midwife, a nurse or someone on that 
                    level. Every time anyone asked our instructor a semi-medical question 
                    (like to describe the pubycoccyxl (kegel) muscle and how it works) she 
                    would get defensive. It was very counterproductive as people would just 
                    stop asking questions like that. I would also rate Bradley very poorly on 
                    it's miserable manual. I'm very glad that I didn't rely solely on that 
                    class for my information and that I studied, read and collected birth 
                    stories from misc.kids for real information.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On the other hand, I think that the goal of Bradley is good. Trying to 
                    have a drug-free birth without unnecessary intervention is a good thing. 
                    But I still think that the class should include information on drugs and 
                    c-sections (we didn't cover that at all) and it should update it's manual 
                    and videos. As a side note, of the 6 couples in my class, only one had the 
                    natural birth experience. One had a c-section and the rest had epidurals 
                    but delivered vaginally.

                    *Editorial Note: * I feel that the above story has a lot to do with the 
                    instructor rather than the method... I always have people who call me 
                    looking for a class talk to several teachers (that's an option in my area) 
                    to compare the level of experience, number of births attended, style, etc. 
                    This is because there are some who have the attitude that no drugs is the 
                    ONLY way to go - I personally believe that my students are intelligent 
                    people who, given the facts, can make their own decisions when the time 
                    comes! I also give information on drugs, complications, and c-section. 
                    Some of the academy videos are outdated but can serve the purpose of 
                    showing natural birth, I have some which were produced in the last 5 
                    years, and I have some which were not made by the academy. I suppliment 
                    my workbook with handouts which I get from newspapers, magazines, the 
                    Academy, and Childbirth Graphics. Please remember: let the buyer beware,

                    We went with the Bradley Method, and were extremely happy we did.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We did quite a bit of reading (I don't have references nearby, but the 
                    usual stuff). We located a Bradley instructor fairly nearby (about 25 mins 
                    away). Actually, we had our choice of two instructors in the area, but one 
                    of the women didn't have any children of her own, so it seemed to us that 
                    she didn't have quite the necessary credentials.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Anyway, the class itself was enjoyable enough, although it went along a 
                    bit slowly for me. Also, because Bradley is a low-tech approach, there is 
                    very little in the way of studies and statistics that are readily 
                    available as part of the coursework: I had to make an extra effort to seek 
                    these things out. The point is, if you want proof that Bradley makes 
                    sense, as opposed to anecdotal hints, it's a little difficult to find. 
                    It does exist, though: I got a lot of useful information off the Net, and 
                    from some other books.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The reading goes from pretty good to really great. Wish I had them here in 
                    the office so I could share the titles. The workbook is pretty elementary, 
                    sometimes even embarrassingly so, but the parts that are good are REALLY 
                    good. For example, the chart that shows what to expect and what to do in 
                    each stage of labor is a MAJOR PLUS during labor, for the coach and the 
                    mother.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The best thing about Bradley is the constant reassurance from the reading 
                    and the classes that you (the mother and the coach) are able to handle the 
                    birth experience using what Nature gave you.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My biggest problem with Bradley was the relaxation stuff: I just couldn't 
                    get into it. So it was useful that we hired our Bradley instructor as a 
                    labor assistant: she was really good at that stuff and was able to help my 
                    wife relax as necessary. (Actually, my wife says I did help her relax, but 
                    I never felt totally comfortable with my ability to do that).
                    <br/><br/>
                    We prepared a Birth Plan in advance, and that was quite helpful not only 
                    in getting the doctors and nurses to know what we wanted, but also in 
                    allowing us to sort out what was really important to us.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My wife went through transition in the car on the way to the hospital. By 
                    the way, without Bradley, and without our labor assistant, we never 
                    would've managed to avoid going to the hospital much earlier. Anyway, 
                    during the trip she did ask for drugs, so we were glad (and so was she, a 
                    few minutes later) that we weren't in the hospital yet while that was 
                    going on. Once we got to the hospital and my wife was able to stand up and 
                    not be cramped in the car anymore she completely forgot that she'd ever 
                    asked for drugs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    By the time we got to the hospital, my wife was 10cm and +2 station. 
                    Yahoo! Then it was just a matter of pushing the baby out.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Five hours later, no baby! He was stuck: he was occipital posterior and 
                    (we later discovered) his little hand was wedged in next to his face, 
                    preventing him from turning. Here's where it gets tricky: the fetal 
                    monitor shows that the baby's heart rate is slowing a bit (after 5 hours 
                    of pushing the poor thing is tired); my wife, who was up all night and 
                    the night before is obviously getting very tired, and the doctors want to 
                    intervene.
                    <br/><br/>
                    There again it was nice having the labor assistant to talk things over 
                    with. In the end we elected to go with a vacuum extractor: 3 minutes 
                    later, a healthy baby conehead! He had a little black and blue mark on top 
                    of his head from the extractor, but otherwise, was great.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Other than a little local anaesthetic used just before the doctor did the 
                    extractor thing, the birth was drug free. Until the moment before birth, 
                    when the baby needed just that little extra help, the entire labor was 
                    free of interventions, and the extractor proved to be a quick and 
                    uncomplicated intervention anyway.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I can't imagine having done this all this successfully without the 
                    preparation afforded us by the Bradley classes and books, and certainly 
                    not without the extra help we got from our labor assistant. Turns out that 
                    the hospital staff was very much in line with how we wanted our birth to 
                    proceed, so that helped things along tremendously.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And, of course, my wife was the real champion, suffering 12 hours of false 
                    labor all night followed by about 18 hours of actual labor the following 
                    night and day. In second stage, she got four good effective pushes from 
                    each contraction, hour after hour. Wow!!

                    people who come to our classes - we try to teach good communication, 
                    but the very vocal few can set the hospital staff against the method...

                    Students who are dead-set against the medical establishment ALWAYS end up 
                    in my classes. Week one of class, during introductions, they always bring 
                    up every way that modern medical practice WILL damage you and your baby if 
                    they get the chance, (now scaring all the other students who have already 
                    had three ultrasounds and used the doptone all along.) Then they proceed 
                    to go to the hospital and announce that they took BRADLEY CLASSES, and 
                    don't you dare touch me with ANYTHING.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The vast majority of my students take my classes, learn lots, and go to 
                    the hospital appropriately assertive and get along just fine with the 
                    hospital staff. Their births go smoothly and everybody's just so happy. 
                    Unfortunately, the staff has NO IDEA that these very nice couples are 
                    also some of those "Radical Bradley Couples" that create so many problems.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I figure that with really radical couples, the best I can do is try to 
                    convince them that they'll get more flies with honey and that NO ONE at 
                    the hospital is out to deliberately harm them or their baby. If I can 
                    convince them that sometimes, having the baby monitored a little is a 
                    GOOD THING, then I think I've done they and their baby a favor.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When the medical people I do inservices for complain about "abrasive, 
                    defensive" bradley students, I remind them that they were that way long 
                    before they got to my classes. (Gee, the underlying assumption here is 
                    that Bradley teachers can take nice mousy people and turn them into 
                    abrasive argumentative parents. Sure gives us alot of power here, huh?)

                    I have had one "Lamaze" baby and 3 "Bradley" babies. I had a paracervical 
                    with birth #1, though I resisted it to the end; the other three babies 
                    were totally natural, and very fulfilling. The reason I switched: I found 
                    out during my first birth that my body's natural inclinations were to do 
                    what I had read about Bradley--- deep breathing, tuning inside----rather 
                    than the externally based Lamaze, which seeks to distract the mother with 
                    outside focal points and different patterns of breathing. What I got most 
                    out of Bradley was a *confidence* in my body's ability to give birth---
                    without drugs---successfully. I withdrew into myself as the labor 
                    progressed, and concentrated on letting go and opening up, cooperating 
                    with the process, allowing it to happen..... I also was able to 
                    communicate to my caregivers and support people when I needed more privacy 
                    in order for all of this to happen. Bradley empowers parents to take 
                    responsibility for their births, rather than hand all of that 
                    responsibility over to a physician.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Nowadays, taking responsibility is probably the ONLY way you can achieve 
                    a natural childbirth. Most Lamaze classes (but not all) are hospital 
                    sponsored and teach what I call "prepared hospital birth". I myself teach 
                    other prenatal classes for a local hospital, and I have sat in meetings 
                    where the content of "Lamaze" classes was altered to suit physician 
                    preferences, such as the "inconvenience" of squatting delivery. The 
                    changes were not for the good of the patient, but for the local doctor's 
                    preferences! Patients are to be encouraged to be cooperative, not 
                    assertive as to their needs and preferences. I realize that there are 
                    probably still a few good Lamaze classes out there...... but only Bradley 
                    is a "standardized" product that serves parents, not the medical 
                    establishment. :-)

                    We took classes in the Bradley Method. Many respondents to my post 
                    suggested that we not hold too strongly to one particular model of birth 
                    (i.e. no drugs). This was good advice, as my wife discovered for the first 
                    time just how painful contractions can be (and she's no wimp -- she once 
                    took only Tylenol as her appendix was rupturing). She had a shot of Nubain 
                    with about 4 hours to go. The contractions were just as painful, but it 
                    allowed her to relax completely between contractions and gather her 
                    strength for the pushing (about 2 hours later). I found that I did not 
                    give a damn about not following Bradley in this regard.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On the other hand, we were glad to have so much preparation and knowledge 
                    about the range of normality/pathology in birth. It allowed us to 
                    confidently refuse the OB's suggestion of immediate induction when we 
                    arrived at the hospital (there was meconium staining in the amniotic fluid 
                    -- we had come to the hospital to check it out). In fact, labor started 
                    spontaneously about 2 hours later.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Also, Bradley's practice of deliberate, concentrated relaxation was useful 
                    throughout the pregnancy and birth. And good nutrition can never be 
                    stressed enough.

                    Birth Plans -
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our birth plan was useful only to the extent that we had to become 
                    educated in order to write one. It never came out of the bag, and besides, 
                    we neglected to write "we will have thick meconium staining" in it :-).

                    I'm writing from the postpartum room. My wife is 5 feet away. She's 
                    recuperating from a section and holding our wonderful son. After a long, 
                    partially prodromal, difficult labor that ran from 2:30 Thursday afternoon 
                    to 10:00 Sunday morning (with a 6 hour period of weak, irregular 
                    contractions on Friday) we agreed with our midwife that it was time to 
                    have a section. Nick was 11 pounds, 6 ounces, and had a 38 cm head 
                    circumference.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We are agreed that the money we spent on Bradley classes was the best 
                    investment we made during the pregnancy. We worked with (and occasionally 
                    argued with) the hospital staff from 5 am Saturday until 8 am Sunday, got 
                    numerous comments from the nursing staff about how well we worked 
                    together, managed labor without medication until about 3 am Sunday, and 
                    made our decisions *together*. Terri tells me how much harder it was to 
                    manage the pain when I needed a break and left her with a nurse. We feel 
                    no misgivings about the section; when we made that decision, we felt that 
                    we'd given natural labor every chance and that it was the right choice for 
                    the health of Terri and the baby.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our Bradley classes prepared me to deal with Terri in pain, us to work 
                    together to deal with the pain, us to work with the hospital staff as 
                    informed patients and to determine our own course of care, us to recognize 
                    important events in the labor, and us to make important and difficult 
                    decisions. I would recommend Bradley to anyone who wants to be an active 
                    team in childbirth.
