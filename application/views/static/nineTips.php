						What you need to know about home birthing.
                    </h2>
                    Many women contemplate giving birth at home because they want to 
                    avoid the high-tech atmosphere and interventions of a hospital. 
                    You're a good candidate for a home birth if you're in good health 
                    and have an uncomplicated pregnancy. Still, most expectant mothers 
                    don't get past the thinking stage -- home births account for less 
                    than 3 percent of all births. Here's what you need to consider if 
                    you're thinking about this option.
					<dl>
						<dt>
							1. Research your options.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							It's extremely unlikely that you'll find an ob-gyn to be your 
							birth attendant. By training, they're taught to treat birth 
							as a medical event with potential complications. In some states 
							naturopathic physicians do a lot of home births. But a midwife 
							is your most likely candidate. Most home births are attended 
							by direct-entry midwives, as opposed to certified nurse-midwives.
						</dd> 
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:
						</dd>
						<dd>
							While this is a good guideline, experience 
							isn't everything.  Education and apprenticeship count too. 
							A newer midwife will be on the cutting edge of research, 
							will probably spend a lot of time answering your questions 
							to ensure everything is normal and will often charge significantly 
							less.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							2. Pick a practitioner with solid experience.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							When interviewing, be sure to ask how many births she's attended, 
							both as a primary (where she was in charge) and as an assistant. 
							You want someone who's been the primary birth attendant in at least 
							100 births, says Chris Ann Beard, a certified nurse-midwife in 
							Portland, Oregon. Make sure the midwife works with an assistant 
							(most do).
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:

							While this is a good guideline, experience isn't everything.  
							Education and apprenticeship count too. A newer midwife will be 
							on the cutting edge of research, will probably spend a lot of 
							time answering your questions to ensure everything is normal and 
							will often charge significantly less.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							3. Make sure the practitioner is comfortable handling emergencies 
							and is bringing appropriate equipment.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Ask specific questions about the range of complications she's 
							handled. She should have the knowledge and equipment necessary 
							to resuscitate a newborn, administer medication to stop a 
							postpartum hemorrhage, and suture a severe laceration.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:
						</dd>
						<dd>
							In Ohio, direct entry midwives may not carry Pitocin or any other 
							prescription medications.  Most use herbs and uterine massage to 
							control postpartum bleeding.  Midwives will use several 
							preventative measures to greatly reduce the changes of a 
							laceration as well as bleeding.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							4. Have an emergency plan.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Ideally, your midwife should have a relationship with a 
							physician or hospital in case the home birth doesn't go as 
							planned. If she doesn't have a doctor she can call to describe 
							what's happened and warn of your arrival, you'll basically be 
							treated as an ER patient, notes Beard. The doctor and staff won't 
							know anything about your medical history, and they will likely be 
							very worried about you and your baby. This often results in more 
							tests and interventions, the very thing many women want to avoid.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:
						</dd>
						<dd>
							You may opt for what is known as "co-care".  When you choose 
							co-care, you see a certified nurse midwife or an OBGYN throughout 
							your pregnancy in addition to seeing your direct entry midwife.  
							In the event that you require transport to the hospital, you have 
							already established a relationship with the doctor of your choice 
							and all your prenatal testing has been done.  This option ensures 
							that you will receive care from the care provider(s) you have 
							chosen and will reduce the chances of unnecessary interventions.  
							You will also want to ask your midwife if she will accompany you 
							to the hospital in the event of a transport.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							5. Decide where you're going to give birth and who will attend
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Depending on how far away you are from a hospital, you may choose 
							to go to a friend's or relative's house once you go into labor. 
							That way, if there's an emergency, you can get to a hospital 
							quickly. There are no rules on how many people should be present 
							at the birth. Whether to include children, family, and friends, 
							or just yourself and your partner (plus the birth attendant and 
							her assistant of course!) is up to you.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							6. Consider having lab work and tests done through a clinic.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Home birth patients sometimes have all of their prenatal lab 
							work and ultrasounds done through a doctor's office, often on 
							the midwife's recommendation. That way their insurance is put 
							to some use. And if the patient ends up being transferred to the 
							hospital, the medical records are already on file.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:
						</dd>
						<dd>
							Again, this is where co-care would come in.  Your CNM or OBGYN 
							would run any lab work and prenatal testing that you consented to.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							7. Check what your insurance will cover.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Many insurance plans don't reimburse for home births. In general, 
							the fee ranges from $500 and $2000, which usually includes prenatal 
							care and six weeks of postpartum care.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							<br/>
							Erika's note:
						</dd>
						<dd>
							The cost of homebirth services varies greatly from midwife to 
							midwife.  In my area alone the range is from $400 to $2200.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							8. Understand there is risk.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Carl Jones says, and I concur, "No one can tell a mother she is 
							perfectly safe giving birth at home. Whether she is safer at home 
							than in a hospital, however, is another question". There is always 
							going to be some risk when giving birth, as in all of life, and 
							women should be carefully screened for any health problems that 
							could be dangerous during labor and delivery. For certain women 
							in rare instances, obstetric care is essential. However, for most 
							women, better, healthier results are seen when mothers chose birth 
							centers or home births. As far as the risk of home birth goes, Our 
							Bodies, Ourselves states, "The times when hospital care unexpectedly 
							becomes instantaneously necessary are rare". In A Good Birth, A 
							Safe Birth, Diana Korte and Roberta Scaer quote Tew, the research 
							statistician, who says, "The danger of home as a place of birth 
							does not lie in its threat to the healthy survival of mothers and 
							babies, but in its threat to the healthy survival of obstetricians 
							and obstetric practice"

								Dr. Lewis Mehl did a study comparing home and hospital birth
								with mothers from California and Wisconsin with matched 
								populations of 2,092 mothers for each group. Midwives and 
								family doctors attended the homebirths; OBGYNs and family 
								doctors attended hospital births. Within the hospital group, 
								the fetal distress rate was 6 times higher. Maternal hemorrhage
								was 3 times higher. Limp, unresponsive newborns arrived 3 times 
								more often. Neonatal infections were 4 times as common. There 
								were 30 permanent birth injuries caused by doctors (Jones 99).
							</li>
							<li>
								Dr. Mehl did another study comparing 1,046 home births with 
								1,046 hospital births. The groups were matched for age, risk 
								factors, etc. There was no difference in infant mortality. 
								None! However the hospital births caused more fetal distress, 
								lacerations to the mother, neonatal infections and so on. 
								There was a higher rate of forceps and C-section delivery and 
								nine times as many episiotomies.
