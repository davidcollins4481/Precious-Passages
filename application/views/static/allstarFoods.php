                    Does it seem like every time you open a newspaper or magazine you 
                    read different advice on diet and health? In one sense you are, but 
                    in another sense it's just that the field of nutrition and diet 
                    therapy is constantly changing as researchers make new discoveries 
                    every day, often changing last year's advice in light of today's 
                    science. One constant theme, though, has emerged over the years
                    -variety in the daily diet has always been associated with better 
                    health. And with variety in mind, your best choices should be foods 
                    that are the most nutrient-dense--the best nutritional-buys for your 
                    grocery dollar. This is a list of what I consider to be the top 25
                    foods everyone should eat.

                    Keep in mind that the foods you choose every day are important not 
                    only for their delicious taste, but for the vital nutrients they 
                    provide, nutrients that keep your body healthy: for growth, repair, 
                    immunity, energy, strength, for concentration and creativity, and for 
                    resistance to illness and disease. When you think of food in terms of 
                    all these amazing functions, what's for dinner takes on a whole new 
                    meaning! These All-Stars are featured in the 60 recipes in Program 
                    Your Baby's Health: the Pregnancy Diet For Your Child's Lifelong 
                    Well-being.
