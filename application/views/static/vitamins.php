                <p>
					A woman eating an ideal diet does not need a vitamin/mineral 
					supplement; and the honest truth is most women will have healthy 
					babies even without taking a supplement.  However, rare is the 
					woman who knows what a perfectly balanced diet is.  Rarer still 
					is the woman who has the discipline, time and resources to never 
					miss a meal.  Armed with this knowledge, I look to a multivitamin 
					and mineral supplement as an insurance policy.  Even when a woman's 
					intake is not perfect, the supplement will fill in the gaps and make 
					sure baby and mom get every nutrient they need every day.
                </p>
                <p>
					This is not to say that a vitamin/mineral supplement can or should 
					replace food.  Food sources of nutrients are always superior because 
					they are more completely absorbed by the body.  It is also important 
					to remember that a vitamin/mineral supplement does not contain protein. 
                </p>
                <p>
					After a lot of research and after trying several supplements myself, I 
					recommend Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal One Multivitamin&trade;.  Not 
					only is this the only vitamin that doesn't make me nauseas, but it 
					is also the most complete prenatal I found.  An added bonus is that 
					you only take one pill a day. 
                </p>
                <p>
