                    Homebirth: As Safe As It Gets
                </h1>
                <p>
					Each year in America, approximately 1% of the births occur in home 
					settings. In Illinois in 1992, 1,218 families filed birth certificates 
					that reflected a homebirth. Approximately one-third of the births 
					occurred to Black families. Wisconsin had 591 recorded homebirths for 
					the same year of which 22 were to Black families. 1 It is probable that 
					many more Illinois homebirths actually took place but weren't recorded 
					due to a discriminatory birth registration practice that places the 
					responsibility for registering midwife-attended homebirths on the 
					parents and requires a different mechanism than is used for any other 
					occurring births.
                </p>
                <p>
					One measure of the safety of birth place is infant mortality, 
					specifically, neonatal deaths within the first 28 days. According to 
					the Center for Disease Control, there were 19,098 neonatal deaths for 
					1990 for babies born in a hospital. For those babies born at home, 
					there were 260 newborn deaths. Infant mortality is figured as the 
					number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The death rate for babies born 
					in the hospital was 5.6 and for those born at home was 11.1, which 
					would seem to indicate that a hospital is a better bet for a baby's 
					survival. However, when the homebirth statistics are further broken 
					down into who attended the birth, the picture changes dramatically. 
					Direct Entry Midwives had the best outcomes with a death rate of 1.9 
					compared to CNM-attended births (2.9) or physicians -- D.O.'s (15.1) or 
					M.D.'s (24.7). 2
                </p>
                <p>
					History Until 1900, homebirth was the place of birth for most every 
					American. In fact, over 90% of those alive on earth today were born at 
					home! Hospital or institutional birth is a relatively new occurance 
					which began to gain in popularity during the 1920's due to physician 
					promotion and the increased use of the automobile. As is the case 
					today, it is a much more economic use of a physician's time to attend 
					patients in a single place. There is also an economic incentive since 
					a physician can attend to more than one patient at a time in the 
					hospital and other, less important helpers can attend to the more 
					mundane tasks of birthing. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Part of this shift in birthplace must be attributed to the propaganda 
					denouncing midwives which took place during this same time. With their 
					economic and organized power, physician groups were able to 
					legislatively increase hospital births by eliminating those who still 
					attended homebirths -- by eliminating the midwife. From the 1930's 
					through the 1960's state after state changed their laws to either 
					restrict the practice of midwifery or wipe out the legal practice 
					entirely. Yet no valid study then or to date has proven planned 
					homebirth to be less safe than hospital birth. 
                </p>
                <h3>
					Studies
                </h3>
                <p>
					Many studies have been done in an attempt to prove that hospitals are 
					the safest place to birth. Some of the earlier ones included all births 
					which took place out of the hospital regardless of the gestational age 
					or planned place of delivery. Those studies included miscarriages which 
					took place at home as well as precipitous births and births that were 
					unattended. To be valid, a study must compare equals and change only 
					one item. Lewis Mehl did this when he matched 2,092 women and compared 
					their birth outcomes. The result was that homebirth with a trained 
					attendant was safer than a hospital birth. 
                </p>
                <h3>
					What does "safer" mean?
                </h3>
                <p>
					Most families do not want to know the statistical odds of having a 
					good outcome, they want to know more concretely exactly how a homebirth 
					will be safer. Many studies address this by listing criteria and 
					comparing the results. For example, Lewis Mehl's study listed the 
					percentage of mothers with various complications:

					As you can see from the chart, many complications seem to occur with 
					greater frequency in the hospital. Many women are told they will need 
					an episiotomy in order to prevent tears but the data from these births 
					shows that this is not so since there were 9 times as many tears in 
					the hospital group! Fetal distress, often cited as the complication 
					necessitating a cesarean section occurred 6 times more frequently in 
					the hospital group. There were 4 times more newborn infections, 22 
					times more forceps deliveries, 30 times more birth injuries and 3 
					times more cesarean sections in the hospital group.

					Estimating Preventable Childbirth Related Deaths
                </h3>
                <p>
					The following statistics, derived from data accumulated between 1940 
					and 1980, are conservative estimates of lives lost due to our system 
					of treating pregnancy as a medical event requiring medical 
					intervention and care. *about 1,000,000 babies died at or before 
					birth that should have lived * about 1,600,000 babies died before 
					their 1st Birthday who should have lived * at least 1,500,000 children 
					were left severely brain damaged by medical procedures * at least 
					45,000,000 children had minimal brain damage who would have been 
					normal Today, it is estimated that 50 newborns die unnecessarily each 
					day whose deaths are preventable if "the five standards for safe 
					childbearing" were employed. This breaks down into a preventable 
					baby death every 29 minutes, every hour of the day, each day of the 
					year. NAPSAC writes, "Since 1940 at least a million babies have died 
					in American hospitals who would have lived were it not for the doctor 
					dominated maternity system that dictates the Standards for American 
					Childbirth."
                </p>
                <h3>
					Who should decide what is safer?
                </h3>
                <p>
					Childbirth is not a laboratory project that can be reproduced at will 
					with the outcomes compared with each other. Nor is birth a medical 
					event, like planned surgery, that can be timed, controlled or forced 
					to obtain the desired outcome. Each year, it seems, scientists 
					discover some aspect of birth that had been unknown or unverified. 
					Also, it would seem that the technologies that are initially hailed 
					as the "cure" for a certain problem are found to produce unacceptable 
					side-effects or increase risks for more serious complications. Birth 
					also has a psychological component which can place some women at 
					incredible risk in a hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
					A recent article in a prestigious magazine looked at homebirth and 
					asked the question, "Is it safe? Is it ethical?" The physician writers 
					concluded that homebirth has a "definite small risk" and that "hospital 
					births entail a wider range of risks". They also felt that since the 
					actual risk factors inherent in a home birth are very small, perhaps 
					1/1000, and the consequences of the birth decision will be borne 
					exclusively by the parents, physicians should support parents who 
					are willing to accept this risk so as to make the experience as safe 
					as possible. The Oxford Perinatal Project also came to this conclusion 
					after an exhaustive look at every scientifically valid study performed 
					since the 1950's addressing aspects of care of pregnant and birthing 
					women and their babies. Since science cannot prove homebirth to be 
					less safe than hospital birth, I believe that each family has the 
					constitutional right to choose where to give birth. I believe that 
					until science can prove a detrimental effect on those who choose to 
					birth at home, medical personal should support families in their 
					decision. The InterNational Association of Parents and Professionals 
					for Safe Alternatives in Childbirth, NAPSAC, shares this view and 
					asks, "Who is to decide what is the optimal balance between medical 
					and psychological risk? . . . It must be the parents."
