                    What is a Direct-Entry Midwife?

                    The term midwife generally implies one of three things, 
                    either a woman has chosen to become a DEM, CPM, or CNM.  
                    Certified Professional Midwives and Direct Entry Midwives 
                    practice in the homebirth or sometimes the birth-center 
                    setting depending on the state in which they practice.  
                    In Ohio, CPM's and DEM's practice only in the homebirth 
                    setting while Certified Nurse Midwives practice in a hospital 
                    setting and maintain a collaborative relationship with doctors.
                </p>

					The path through which a midwife has chosen her education 
					varies from woman to woman and includes an academic program 
					of study, an apprenticeship or both.  There is no "more correct" 
					method of education.  Rather, there are different paths that lead 
					to the same goal of serving birthing couples in the homebirth or 
					hospital setting.  Interview your midwife as you would any other 
					care provider.  Ask a lot of questions and make sure you are 
					comfortable with the answers. 
                </p>

					As your DEM I will provide prenatal care for the mother as well 
					as labor and postpartum care for both the mother and the baby.  
					I have a special interest in prenatal nutrition, VBAC and waterbirth.  
					My education is through the Michigan School of Traditional Midwifery.  
					Additional training includes adult, child and infant CPR with AED,  
					First Aid, Neonatal Resuscitation, and breastfeeding certifications.    
					My birth experience has included lots of natural vaginal birth as 
					well as twins, episiotomy, vacuum, cesarean section, 
					epidural/narcotic anesthesia, water birth, VBAC, single mothers, 
					breastfeeding, bottle feeding and special needs infants.
                </p>
                
                <p>
					Homebirth requires a large amount of personal responsibility for 
					both your pregnancy and your birth.  While I am present to safeguard 
					the passage of mother and child through the birth process, you are 
					ultimately responsible for your birth.  A high level of commitment 
					to health (mental, physical and spiritual) through birth preparation 
					and prenatal nutrition is essential.  I cannot stress this enough; 
					if you do not honestly prepare for your birth during your pregnancy, 
					no amount of midwifery care will change the outcome.
