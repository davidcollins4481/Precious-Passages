					Aromatherapy is the practice of using essential oils to affect the 
					body in some way.  During labor and birth essential oils (EO) can be 
					used to relieve pain and anxiety, to augment a slow labor or to slow 
					a fast labor.  Following are a few articles that describe aromatherapy 
					as well as some references to books.  I recently discovered Iris Oils.  
					Joy Black has created several oil blends for laboring women.

						Aromatherapy
					</h3>
					Aromatherapy is "the science of using highly concentrated essential 
					oils or essences distilled from plants in order to utilize their 
					therapeutic properties."<sup>[64]</sup> For the purposes of this 
					article, we focus on the use of essential oils to reduce anxiety and 
					pain in labor. Aromatherapy for these purposes has not been studied 
					with properly controlled trials. This modality is included here 
					because its use in maternity care is increasing, and experts state 
					that "Essential oils are as potent as pharmacological drugs and are 
					equally open to misuse or abuse, whether intentional or not," and, "... 
					until more clinical research trials have been undertaken it would be 
					prudent for midwives to work cautiously with essential oils, using the 
					lowest possible dose and on the least number of occasions."<sup>[64]</sup>
					<h4>
						Effectiveness of Aromatherapy in Reducing Pain and Suffering 
						During Labor
					</h4>
					One large, uncontrolled prospective study<sup>[65]</sup> reported on 
					the use and effectiveness of aromatherapy in a large referral maternity 
					unit in the United Kingdom over an 8-year period between 1990 and 1998. 
					During this time, 8058 women received aromatherapy during labor under 
					the supervision of midwives trained in aromatherapy. It was used for a 
					variety of purposes: to reduce fear, anxiety, and pain; to reduce 
					nausea or vomiting; to enhance women's sense of well-being; and to 
					improve contractions.
					<br/><br/>
					Meticulous records were kept regarding the oils used, the mode and 
					timing of administration, and reasons for use. Mothers and midwives 
					reported on the effectiveness of the oils in accomplishing the purpose 
					for which it was given.
					<br/><br/>
					Sixty-one percent of the women received aromatherapy (lavender, rose, 
					or frankincense) to relieve anxiety and fear. Fifty percent of both 
					mothers and midwives found it helpful, and 13% found it unhelpful. 
					Rose oil was rated helpful by most (71%), followed by lavender (50%). 
					Lavender and frankincense were used for pain by 537 women, of whom 54% 
					found lavender helpful and 64% found frankincense helpful.
					<br/><br/>
					Essential oils have a range of possible adverse effects on the woman, 
					as well as on others in the room, because they are volatile and produce 
					vapors that are inhaled by everyone in the vicinity. One percent 
					(n = 100) of women in the study<sup>[65]</sup> reported undesired effects 
					associated with the use of aromatherapy; all were minor (nausea, 
					rash, headache, or rapid labor). It is not clear whether they were 
					caused by essential oils, other factors, or by labor itself.
					<br/><br/>
					In conclusion, aromatherapy is inexpensive and popular with laboring 
					women and midwives. One large uncontrolled study reported that the 
					majority of users found it helpful in reducing pain and anxiety. On 
					the basis of these findings, and its increasing popularity, this 
					modality merits further scientific study to establish its rightful 
					place in maternity care.

						Aromatherapy for labour and birth

					<h4>
						Benefits of aromatherapy
					</h4>
					The ancient art of aromatherapy - the use of essential oils of plants 
					and herbs - is a safe, non-invasive, natural treatment for both body 
					and mind. Many midwives and other birth professionals are now 
					incorporating aromatherapy into their practice as a gentle and 
					effective way of helping relax the labouring woman, ease pain and 
					calm anxiety - either on its own or alongside conventional methods of 
					pain relief.  If you are planning to have a completely natural labour 
					you'll find aromatherapy an invaluable tool for helping to calm your 
					mind, fortify your mood, soothe pain and alleviate discomfort - without 
					any of the potential side-effects of pain relieving drugs.  Of course, 
					however much you plan, no one can predict what your labour and birth 
					will be like. However even if you opt to avail yourself of the full 
					panoply of medical aids to labour - or if your labour is not 
					straightforward - aromatherapy can still be helpful used alongside 
					conventional procedures.  To get the most out of aromatherapy during 
					labour it helps to familiarize yourself with the oils and their uses 
					during pregnancy. That way you'll know how to use them to best effect 
					during labour. In fact you'll probably find that if you've used oils 
					before certain ones have an instantly calming or uplifting effect.  
					It's a good idea to assemble a kit of aromatherapy preparations ready 
					for labour making sure that each bottle is labelled with your name. 
					Keep them in a cool place that is easy to get at so you can start using 
					them when you feel the first twinges of contractions and/or pop them 
					into your labour bag when you go into hospital.
					<br/><br/>
					Benefits of aromatherapy during labour include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							certain oils help energise and uplift, giving you the 
							confidence to approach labour calmly
						</li>
						<li>
							it can help speed up a labour that is progressing slowly
						</li>
						<li>
							it can help calm and soothe if contractions are coming thick 
							and fast without respite
						</li>
						<li>
							certain oils have a tonic effect on the uterus and can be used 
							to encourage labour to start if you have gone much beyond your 
							expected date of delivery and induction is being considered
						</li>
						<li>
							used in massage or in a soothing bath it can help alleviate 
							the pain of contractions, quell nerves and ease anxiety
						</li>
						<li>
							some oils can be used to help enhance the action of the uterus 
							and make contractions more effective
						</li>
						<li>
							it can be used to lift mood and allay fatigue, especially in 
							the transitional stage of labour, when it's common to feel 
							tired and discouraged
						</li>
						<li>
							certain oils help open the air passages and ease breathing 
							especially if you are hyperventilating during the second stage 
							of labour
						</li>
						<li>
							certain oils have antiseptic properties enabling them to be 
							used to cleanse the air in the delivery room and protect you 
							from germs in hospital baths and showers
						</li>
						<li>
							oils can be used during the third stage of labour to help 
							stimulate the uterus to expel the placenta Using aromatherapy 
							during labour
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>
					Essential oils can be used in a variety of different ways during 
					labour. They can be added to aromatic baths to help ease pain and 
					enhance progress. For example during the early phases of labour a 
					relaxing warm bath with a few drops of an essential oil such as 
					lavender added is very comforting and can enable you get some sleep, 
					if you go into labour during the night.
					<br/><br/>
					When labour becomes established and contractions become stronger a 
					warm bath is a great pain reliever and (taken at the right stage) can 
					help enhance the effectiveness of contractions.
					<br/><br/>
					Oils can also be added to warm water and used on a flannel or compress 
					and applied to your lower back or abdomen to help alleviate pain or to 
					wipe your face and neck during the tumultuous second stage when your 
					body is working hard to push your baby out into the world to refresh 
					and calm you.
					<br/><br/>
					They can also be inhaled from a tissue, used in a room spray and/or 
					vapourised ina special vapouriser or burner and used to scent the 
					delivery room.
					<br/><br/>
					If you're planning to do this check with the midwife if you are having 
					a hospital birth as some labour wards have rules about the use of such 
					devices.
					<br/><br/>
					But where the oils most come into their own is in a variety of 
					different types of massage. Once your baby is born a compress placed 
					on your abdomen can help your body to expel the placenta.
					<br/><br/>
					But don't do just one thing use your imagination and mix and match 
					aromatherapy treatments : aromatic baths with compresses, massage, 
					inhalations and changing position. This will help maximise the 
					benefits of aromatherapy for both you and your baby.

					<h4>
						Massage in labour
					</h4>
					It's a natural human instinct to rub away a hurt or pain and this is 
					especially true during labour. An aromatherapy massage given by your 
					partner or a member of your birth team is a wonderful, way to help you 
					relax and soothe the pain of contractions. The oils help reduce 
					friction on the skin at the same time as having therapeutic benefits.  
					Almost any type of massage can be safely used during labour. You may, 
					for instance, just want someone to place a comforting hand on your 
					lower back or sacrum. Alternatively you may prefer a firmer more 
					vigorous touch. Massage can be performed in virtually any position 
					that you adopt during labour. Many women find having the abdomen, 
					thighs or lower back massages is especially helpful. If you are a 
					potential birth companion it's as well to acquaint yourself with a 
					few simple massage techniques and find out how your partner likes to 
					be massaged so that it is second nature by the time she goes into 
					labour.  Not all women like to be touched when they are in labour so, 
					when the time comes, play it by ear and respond to your your partner's 
					mood.				
					<br/><br/>
					Massage during labour can be performed in many different ways depending 
					on how you feel at the time.
					<br/><br/>
					Light, fingertip massage concentrating on your face, upper back and 
					limbs between contractions is enormously soothing and comforting, as 
					you rest and relax and your body prepares itself for the next 
					tremendous wave of energy to surge through your uterus.
					<br/><br/>
					If you are coping with contractions but feel anxious a foot massage 
					can be extremely soothing. Cold feet are often quite literally a 
					problem during labour because all your energy is concentrated in 
					your uterus. A comforting foot massage will both increase circulation 
					and so help warm your feelt and may also help increase the effectivness 
					of contractions by stimulating acupressure points on the sole and heel 
					allowing chi (the body's vital energy) to flow more freely.
					<br/><br/>
					During contractions a firmer pressure is often appreciated to 
					counteract the discomfort. Many women especially enjoy having the 
					sacral area of the lower back massaged, especially if they are 
					experiencing a "backache labour" in which contractions are felt 
					mainly in the lower spine, from where the nerves supplying your 
					uterus emerge. You are especially likely to have a backache labour 
					if your baby is lying in a posterior position (with his back to your 
					spine). And because the baby has further to turn this kind of labour 
					often goes on longer. Massage of the sacral area of the lower back 
					between contractions can be particularly soothing and relaxing and 
					may also help make contractions more effective and even encourage the 
					baby's head to turn. A back massage can be performed in almost any 
					position where you are kneeling, leaning forward or standing.
					<br/><br/>
					Inner thigh massage can also be marvelously soothing, especially if, 
					as often happens towards the end of the first stage of labour, the 
					pain of contractions spreads down to your upper thighs. It can be done 
					with you sitting comfortably upright on a chair, birth ball, the floor 
					or a bed.
					<h4>
						Perineal massage
					</h4>
					During the last few weeks of pregnancy massage of the perineum, the 
					area of tissue between your vagina and your anus, which stretches 
					during birth to allow your baby to emerge, will increase the 
					elasticity of the skin. In fact, a number of reputable research 
					studies have shown that perineal massage carried out in the last 
					six weeks or so of pregnancy can significantly reduce the risk of 
					needing an episiotomy ( a cut made in the perineum to help enlarge 
					the vaginal opening as the baby is born). (1)You can either do this 
					yourself using a mirror to view the perineum or if you like it is a 
					wonderful way for your partner to help you prepare for birth. A few 
					drops of non-scented oil are used to massage the vagina and the 
					perineum gently stretching it, and paying particular attention to 
					any previous scars from an episiotomy or tear.
					<h4>
						Healing the perineum
					</h4>
					Despite all the preparation in the world you may not be able to 
					avoid having an episiotomy or a natural tear. And even if you have 
					managed to have a completely natural birth with no intervention your 
					perineum may still feel a little tender and sore. The sooner the 
					perineum heals the sooner you will be able to move and sit comfortably 
					and start enjoying motherhood to the full. You can encourage perineal 
					healing - whether you have had an episiotomy, sustained a tear or 
					simply feel a bit bruised - by doing your pelvic floor exercises to 
					help increase healing blood to the area and by taking regular healing 
					herbal baths to enhance the natural healing proecess.  We've combined 
					three of the world's most healing herbs to create a healing herbal 
					bath that will help prevent infection, heal the skin and encourage 
					new skin cells to grow: St John's Wort (hypericum), which is soothing, 
					antiseptic and analgesic, marigold (calendula officianalis) widely 
					recognized for its soothing healing properties for skin problems and 
					inflammation and comfrey (symphytum officinale) the healing herb par 
					excellence for easing the pain and swelling of bruises and helping to 
					heal cuts, grazes and wounds of all kinds. The herbal bath can be 
					added either to a conventional bath or bidet, Sitz bath (when the 
					lower half of your body is immersed only) or simply to flush over 
					the perineum if you are confined to bed.
					<br/><br/>
					If you've had a Caesarean a soothing herbal bath can also help relax 
					you and encourage the incision wound to heal more rapidly. And the 
					oils can also be used to help your baby's umbilicus to avoid becoming 
					infected and heal quickly. Lavender oil is another great aid to 
					perineal healing. Research carried out at Huntingdon's Hinchinbrooke 
					Hospital has found that the use of lavender oil in the bath led to 
					greater comfort of the perineum between the third and fifth days after 
					delivery.
