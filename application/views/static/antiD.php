						Abstract
					</h3>
					This article presents the results of a qualitative study which 
					explored the knowledge and beliefs held by midwives regarding the 
					necessity for postnatal anti-D administration to all rhesus negative 
					woman who have given birth to rhesus positive babies. Data were 
					collected using interviews, electronic mail dialogue and written notes 
					from 17 midwives in 8 countries who considered themselves practitioners 
					within the 'midwifery model'*. The data were analysed using grounded 
					theory. The results showed that the midwives do not believe that anti-D 
					is necessary for all woman, and that a number of factors may mitigate a 
					woman's need for this product. It was suggested that the need for anti-D 
					may, in part, be iatrogenic.

					<h3>
						Introduction 
					</h3>
					For a number of years, midwives have been embracing a philosophy of 
					evidence-informed practice. One of the effects of this movement has 
					been that, when held up to close scrutiny, most of the interventions 
					introduced into physiological birth have been discovered to be futile, 
					and sometimes harmful, when used on a routine basis. 
					<br/>
					The routine postnatal administration of anti-D to rhesus negative woman 
					who have given birth to a rhesus positive baby is one of the very few 
					interventions which has not, to date, been challenged by midwife 
					researchers. Anti-D is generally regarded as one of the medical 
					world's 'success stories'; a product which has saved the lives of 
					potentially thousands of babies. Yet more and more woman are 
					questioning their need for this product, in the light of concerns 
					about blood-borne pathogens and the risks to their immune system. 
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Background 
					</h3>
					In 1963, it was suggested that the administration of intramuscular 
					anti-D immunoglobulin cleared fetal red cells from the maternal 
					circulation and prevented rhesus isoimmunisation (1). Following this 
					proposition, 9 clinical trials (2-10) were set up between 1968 and 1971 
					in Western Europe, Canada and the US in order to test this theory. The 
					results of these clinical trials, which were considered to have proved 
					this theory, led to the decision to administer this product on a routine 
					basis. This policy has remained largely unchanged to the present day, 
					with more recent research focusing on the specific dose required and 
					the issue of antenatal administration.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Literature Review
					</h3>
					A systematic review of the literature was undertaken at the onset of 
					this project and a research protocol was developed as a tool for 
					evaluation of original research papers. Application of this protocol 
					to the 9 clinical trials showed that only two of these had utilised 
					effective randomisation and the double-blind inquiry method, which 
					suggests that the results may be subject to bias. One of these (8) 
					was set up in response to what the authors felt were the methodological 
					shortcomings of initial work in this area, but this was stopped after 
					only 54 women were entered because anti-D was offered to all women on 
					the basis of previous research. 
					<br/>
					The results of the trials showed that, on a population basis, anti-D 
					was effective in preventing rhesus isoimmunisation. However, a closer 
					look at the data shows that anti-D may not be necessary for all women: 
					between 1.96% (3/153) and 13.39% (15/112) of women in the control 
					groups were isoimmunised at 6 months postpartum. Overall, the average 
					rate of isoimmunisation of women in the control groups was 7.5%, which 
					implies that around 90% of woman may not need anti-D.
					<br/>
					No research has yet considered why some women need anti-D while others 
					remain unaffected. It is impossible to predict from the clinical trials 
					whether this is a detectable difference, whether protection is likely 
					to be conferred by some pre-existing condition or could be due to 
					differences in transplacental haemorrhage or antibody production 
					following exposure to the rhesus antigen. 
					<br/>
					It seems unlikely from the research evidence that transplacental 
					haemorrhage is inevitable at any stage of pregnancy or birth. This is 
					seen in around 15% of cases where a rhesus negative woman gives birth 
					to a rhesus positive baby (11-13). We do not know whether 
					transplacental haemorrhage is related to maternal or birth-related 
					factors, although a study of the incidence of this during curettage 
					following abortion found that trauma to the uterus increased its 
					likelihood (14).
					<br/>
					No research has been carried out into the long term implications or 
					potential risks of routine postnatal anti-D administration either for 
					women or subsequent babies, although there has been controversy about 
					this in some areas (15). There is evidence of the transmission of the 
					HIV (16) and Hepatitis C (17) viruses in anti-D, although the absolute 
					risk of transmission of viral or other infectious material in blood is 
					unquantifiable, because of the possibility of as yet undiscovered 
					pathogens (18).
					<br/>
					Anecdotally, a number of woman report short-term but unpleasant 
					rashes, flu-like symptoms and compromise to their immune systems 
					for up to two years following anti-D administration. Some midwives 
					are also questioning whether anti-D may have negative effects on the 
					reproductive health of subsequent babies, particularly girls, whose 
					blood composition may be affected by the effects of the product on 
					their mother's immune system or blood composition or their own DNA. 
					There is general agreement that further work needs to be undertaken 
					into the risks and adverse effects of postnatal anti-D in women and 
					subsequent babies (18,19).
					<br/>
					The historical context of this research is an important consideration. 
					The decision to routinely administer anti-D was made on the strength 
					of the evidence from the clinical trials. At the time, the focus was 
					on preventing rhesus disease in babies, and this was achieved. However, 
					the results of the reseach show that not all women need anti-D, 
					although no attempts were made to determine whether this was 
					predictable. 
					<br/>
					The environment of maternity care has undergone myriad changes since 
					this decision was made. There is a need to provide information for 
					individual women, while enabling these women to make informed choices 
					about their care. Midwives are in a difficult position with regard to 
					informing women about anti-D, and a number of women are currently 
					questioning the need for this intervention. The fact that none of this 
					research included midwives, or was undertaken within a midwifery model 
					was one of the main issues which led to this study.

					<h3>
						Aims of the Study 
					</h3>
					The aims of this study were twofold:
					<ol>
						<li>
							To explore the nature of the beliefs, knowledge, views and 
							ideas in relation to the area of postnatal anti-D 
							administration of midwives who practise within the midwifery 
							model and believe strongly in the normality of the birth 
							process. It was felt that this may serve to expand the 
							evidence in this area, acknowledging that evidence may come 
							from sources other than quantitative research.
						</li>
						<li>
							To determine whether analysis of this knowledge adds to the 
							debate and / or supports the development of an alternative
							paradigm from that which currently exists in relation to 
							postnatal anti-D administration.
						</li>
					</ol>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Methodology 
					</h3>
					Quantitative research evidence is not the only form of knowledge 
					acceptable to and useful in midwifery practice. Midwives may use 
					tacit knowledge or intuitive judgement, they develop knowledge 
					through their own experience and that of the women they serve, 
					and they acquire knowledge through their senses (20). Because the 
					medical model traditionally uses a positivist, quantitative approach, 
					and this study aimed to explore other types of evidence, qualitative 
					methods were considered the most appropriate. Grounded theory was 
					chosen as the specific research method as it allows for on-going 
					development of theory which is 'grounded' in actual research 
					information (21).
					<br/>
					A combination of purposive and convenience sampling was employed in 
					this study and participants were targeted in a number of ways. 
					Colleagues who had previously expressed an interest in the area and
					midwives on Internet discussion lists were invited to participate. A 
					short article outlining the study topic and inviting responses was 
					also published in an international midwifery journal (22). These 
					methods also led to a degree of snowballing, where participants told 
					other midwives about the research; this led to further responses.
					<br/>
					Altogether, 17 midwives from eight countries participated in this 
					study. All of the midwives considered themselves as practising within 
					the 'midwifery model' and may be accurately termed 'holistic' in their 
					approach to midwifery. Each provided a detailed initial written 
					response to a 'trigger' set of study questions which detailed their 
					thoughts, feelings, beliefs and knowledge in this area. The second 
					stage of data collection involved semi-structured interviews with 
					five of the participants, and electronic mail dialogue with another 
					seven, in order to clarify responses and seek further information in 
					relevant areas. While it is recognised that using e-mail to collect 
					data is a new area, and not without problems, this was the only way 
					in which dialogue with midwives from countries as far apart as Japan, 
					Australia and Mexico was able to take place. 
					<br/>
					The data was analysed on an on-going basis. Responses were studied and 
					broken down into initial categories which emerged through the data. 
					These categories were refined and linked according to later data. 
					Efforts were made to ensure that responses were used accurately and 
					in context, and a hermaneutic approach was used once the results had 
					been collated to 'check back' with five of the participants, who all 
					agreed that the findings of the study accurately represented their 
					original meaning.
                </p>

					<h3>
						Results
					</h3>
					Aspects of three of the main categories derived from this study are 
					described below, together with direct quotes from the participating 
					midwives to illustrate their meanings and knowledge in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						1. Anti-D as a routine intervention: midwifery philosophy
					</h3>
					<blockquote>
						"No intervention is necessary on a routine basis"
					</blockquote>
					In terms of their philosophy, most of the midwives who participated 
					felt that there was no such thing as an intervention which was 
					justifiable on a routine basis. This was hardly surprising, 
					considering that the research targeted midwives who considered 
					themselves practitioners within the midwifery model. The overwhelming 
					feeling which came through the data was that midwives felt there had 
					to be some sort of 'explanation' for the need for anti-D, and that 
					this information was vital to women.
					<br/>
					Almost all of the participants directly stated that they felt anti-D 
					was probably not necessary on a routine basis, and a number of reasons 
					were given for this:
					<blockquote>
						"I do not think anti-D is necessary on a routine basis because 
						of the associated expense / maternal risk factors. I only arrange 
						for the administration of anti-D to my clients if there is a 
						clinical indicator for its use during pregnancy or after birth."
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"I KNOW [participant's emphasis] in my heart that anti-D is not 
						necessary for all of these women. All of my experience as a 
						midwife confirms to me that birth works. I just wish I knew 
						why ... [and] exactly what affects this."
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"I just find it incredibly hard to accept that there is such a 
						huge loophole in such a sophisticated system."
					</blockquote>
					This 'midwifery model' perspective - that anti-D is not necessary on 
					a routine basis, and that there is likely to be an explanation for 
					individual variations in relation to this issue - contrasts vividly 
					with the stance of the medical model, where rhesus isoimmunisation is 
					seen to be akin to a potential disease requiring treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						2. The need for anti-D: historical factors 
					</h3>
					<blockquote>
						"If anti-D is necessary for some women, there must be a reason why."
					</blockquote>
					One of the themes which emerged was the question of whether some 
					women's need for anti-D had been cause by another factor. Again, 
					this perspective contrasts with the medical view that the need for 
					anti-D is inherent and the result of an immunological 'malfunction' 
					in all women's bodies. Although speculation in this area took a number 
					of different directions, the main focus was on problems caused by the 
					medicalisation of birth:
					<blockquote>
						"[At the time of the clinical trials] we were doing managed 
						third stage … and all women got an epis[iotomy]. Well, I 
						wonder how many of those women would have been sensitised 
						if we had done more physiological third stages; whether 
						this was causing higher rates of sensitisation than might 
						happen in a normal population of women who had natural birth."
					</blockquote>
					Following discussion of iatrogenesis came the suggestion that the 
					rate of isoimmunisation in physiological birth may be so low that 
					giving anti-D to all women would no longer be justified by a 
					risk-benefit analysis:
					<blockquote>
						"And if we knew what the real rate [of isoimmunisation in 
						physiological birth] was, well maybe the risks of anti-D 
						would be a more relevant factor. We should be looking at 
						the data for real woman - individually and now - not the 
						population that had their birth messed with in 1969!"
					</blockquote>
					The point was made that rhesus disease may, if left alone, have been 
					a self-limiting condition. One midwife summarised this by saying:
					<blockquote>
						"Ironically, it may be because we have placed such a high 
						value on the individual human life that, on a population 
						level, we are going to suffer the consequences. I say ironically 
						because doctors tend to ignore the individual in favour of the 
						population in their research; it's a bit of a paradox when you 
						think about it."
					</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						3. The need for anti-D: factors limiting sensitisation 
					</h3>
					<blockquote>
						"Birth works, if you trust it, understand it, and respect it."
					</blockquote>
					Midwives cited a number of factors which they felt were involved in 
					isoimmunisation. It was felt that isoimmunisation was not a normal 
					feature of physiological birth and, in particular, that intervention 
					in the third stage was a primary cause of isoimmunisation:
					<blockquote>
						"Isoimmunisation doesn't worry me all that much. I know of 
						several older women with negative blood types who had 
						thirteen children and never had anti-D. I tend to trust 
						that nature knows what it does."
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"Why is there a chorion and an amnion? We need to ask - why 
						does the chorionic plate exist at all? Unless maternal and 
						fetal circulations were not meant to mix."
					</blockquote>
					Other responses in this category have been summarised in Tables 
					1 and 2. Table 1 lists the factors which are thought to influence 
					the likelihood of isoimmunisation, while table 2 lists the factors 
					which midwives felt might give protection against isoimmunisation.

					<h3>
						Discussion 
					</h3>
					The participating midwives offered a vast range of both general and 
					specific knowledge and ideas within the midwifery model; only a small 
					portion of which can be included here due to limitations of space. 
					They demonstrate a move away from the 'received view' in the area, 
					offering a range of ideas to explain the issues concerned and with a 
					very definite focus on the practicalities of midwifery practice. 
					Interestingly, the data collected is not really at variance with the 
					scientific research concerning anti-D; the difference between data 
					collected in this study and current medical views is more one of 
					philosophy.
					<br/>
					It could be argued that it is only within the medical paradigm that 
					anti-D is seen as being necessary as a preventative measure for all 
					rhesus negative woman who have given birth to a rhesus positive baby; 
					the midwives in this study viewed this as an intervention which might 
					be offered to appropriate women, but added that these woman should
					realise that they had a range of choices in this area.
					<br/>
					Where midwives view the process of birth as a natural event which 
					has a social and spiritual meaning, issues surrounding isoimmunisation 
					are viewed in a different light. Medicalisation has caused the issue 
					of rhesus negativity to become labelled with a notion of pathology, 
					while these midwives see the issue as based in physiology. This is in 
					keeping with the well-documented effects of Cartesian dualism on the 
					medical model of birth (23). As it is now understood that this dualist
					model and a total focus on the physical bear little relation to the 
					dynamic and holistic nature of birth, the evidence gained from this 
					study suggests that the medical research on which policies concerning 
					anti-D are based offer only a small part of the evidence in this area. 
					The implication of this is that we are simply not able to offer women 
					enough information upon which they can base an informed choice. 
					<br/>
					The study also highlights the issue of unbiased information- giving to 
					women; whatever the views or philosophy of the individual midwife, 
					women need to have accurate and up-to-date information upon which they 
					can base their choices. Perhaps midwives offering women information 
					also need to be honest about their personal philosophical standpoint, 
					in order that women can put the information they receive into this 
					context. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Conclusion
					</h3>
					This study by no means provides all of the answers; in many ways, it 
					simply raises more questions. Several areas with potential for further 
					research have been highlighted by the results, and the study has 
					generated a great deal of 'new' information for consideration and 
					reflection by midwives. At the onset of this study, I wondered if 
					anti-D was the exception to the general rule that no intervention was 
					necessary on a routine basis in birth. These midwives have helped to 
					demonstrate that this may not be the case. Yet there remains a great 
					deal of work to be done, in order to clarify the decision and the 
					issues, both for midwives and women.
					<br/>
					* It should be noted that the term 'midwifery model' is used here in a 
					very specific sense, which may necessitate clarification. The 
					'midwifery model' describes a philosophical and practical approach 
					to birth and midwifery which focuses strongly on the concepts of 
					physiology, normality and holism. Proponents of this attitude are 
					focused on the needs of the woman and trust in women's bodies, birth 
					and nature. It is an integrating approach which has been further 
					explored by Davis-Floyd (24), who contrasts the midwifery (or 
					wholistic) model with the technocratic approach to birth, and by 
					the Midwives Alliance of North America (25) who define the model 
					further in their Statement of Values and Ethics. Participants in 
					this study were aware of this conceptualisation of this model and 
					deemed themselves practitioners within this philosophy.
