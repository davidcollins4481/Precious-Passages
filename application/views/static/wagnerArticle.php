					INTRODUCTION
				</h3>
                <p>
					Humanizing birth means understanding that the woman giving birth 
					is a human being, not a machine and not just a container for making 
					babies. Showing women---half of all people---that they are inferior 
					and inadequate by taking away their power to give birth is a tragedy 
					for all society. On the other hand, respecting the woman as an 
					important and valuable human being and making certain that the 
					woman's experience while giving birth is fulfilling and empowering 
					is not just a nice extra, it is absolutely essential as it makes the 
					woman strong and therefore makes society strong.
                </p>
                <p>
					Humanized birth means putting the woman giving birth in the center 
					and in control so that she and not the doctors or anyone else makes 
					all the decisions about what will happen. Humanized birth means 
					understanding that the focus of maternity services is community 
					based primary care, not hospital based tertiary care with midwives, 
					nurses and doctors all working together in harmony as equals. 
					Humanized birth means maternity services which are based on good 
					scientific evidence including evidence based use of technology and 
					drugs.
                </p>
                <p>
					But we do not have humanized birth in many places today. Why? Because 
					fish can't see the water they swim in. Birth attendants, be they 
					doctors, midwives or nurses, who have experienced only hospital based, 
					high interventionist, medicalized birth cannot see the profound effect 
					their interventions are having on the birth. These hospital birth 
					attendants have no idea what a birth looks like without all the 
					interventions, a birth which is not dehumanized. This widespread 
					inability to know what normal, humanized birth is has been summarized 
					by the World Health Organization:
                </p>
                <p>
					"By medicalizing birth, i.e. separating a woman from her own 
					environment and surrounding her with strange people using strange 
					machines to do strange things to her in an effort to assist her, the 
					woman's state of mind and body is so altered that her way of carrying 
					through this intimate act must also be altered and the state of the 
					baby born must equally be altered. The result it that it is no longer 
					possible to know what births would have been like before these 
					manipulations. Most health care providers no longer know what 
					"non-medicalized" birth is. The entire modern obstetric and 
					neonatological literature is essentially based on observations of 
					"medicalized" birth." <sup>World Health Organization (1)</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
					Why is medicalized birth necessarily dehumanizing? In medicalized 
					birth the doctor is always in control while the key element in 
					humanized birth is the woman in control of her own birthing and 
					whatever happens to her. No patient has ever been in complete control 
					in the hospital---if a patient disagrees with the hospital management 
					and has failed in attempts to negotiate the care, her only option is 
					to sign herself out of the hospital. Giving women choice about certain 
					maternity care procedures is not giving up control since doctors 
					decides what choices women will be given and doctors still have the 
					power to decide whether or not they will acquiesce to a woman's choice. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Fifteen years ago in Fortaleza, Brazil, a World health Organization 
					Conference recommended birth be controlled, not just by individual 
					doctors and hospitals but by evidenced based care monitored by the 
					government. Birth, which had been taken from the community and slowly 
					but surly changed into hospital-based care during the last hundred 
					years, is to be given back to the community. Now the present 
					conference will consider the next step---giving birth back to the 
					woman and her family. Doctors are human; birthing women are human. 
					To err is human. Women have the right to have any errors committed 
					during their birthing be their own and not someone else's.
                </p>
                <p>
					Labour and birth are functions of the autonomic nervous system and 
					are therefore out of conscience control. Consequently there are, in 
					principle, two approaches to assisting at birth: work with the woman 
					to facilitate her own autonomic responses---humanized birth; override 
					biology and superimpose external control using interventions such as 
					drugs and surgical procedures---medicalized birth. 
                </p>
                <p>
					In practice, care during birth may include a combination of the two 
					approaches: facilitation of the woman's own responses usually 
					dominating out-of-hospital management of birth while the 
					superimposition of external controls usually dominates hospital birth 
					management. But whether the care is medicalized or truly humanized 
					depends on whether or not the woman giving birth is in absolute 
					control. 
                </p>
                <h3>
					WHY MEDICALIZED BIRTH
				</h3>
                <p>
					The past fifteen years has seen a struggle between these two 
					approaches to maternity care become intense and global. Today 
					there are three kinds of maternity care: the highly medicalized, 
					"high tech", doctor centered, midwife marginalized care found, 
					for example, in the USA, Ireland, Russia, Czech Republic, France, 
					Belgium, urban Brazil; the humanized approach with strong, more 
					autonomous midwives and much lower intervention rates found, for 
					example, in the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Scandinavian 
					countries; a mixture of both approaches found, for example, in 
					Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan, Australia. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Before 200 years ago all birth care was humanized as it kept the 
					woman in the center and, in general, respected nature and culture. 
					Today in developing countries there are usually medicalized maternity 
					services in the big cities while in the rural areas medicalized 
					services have not yet penetrated and humanized services remain.
                </p>
                <p>
					Today prevalent medical opinion is that "modern", i.e. Western 
					obstetric-intensive maternity care saves lives and is part of 
					development and attempts to bring maternity care excesses under 
					control are retrogressive. The present situation in developing 
					countries reinforces the idea that the only reason out-of-hospital, 
					midwife intensive birth still exists in places is because modern 
					medical practice is not yet available. 
                </p>
                <p>
					But we override biology at our peril. For example, if we stop using 
					our bodies, they go wrong. It is "modern" to get around in a car or 
					public transport resulting in little walking much less running. Then 
					science finds out that our bodies need such exercise or we get 
					cardiovascular problems. So today the post-modern idea is to go back 
					to walking and running (jogging) and this is seen as progressive, not 
					retrogressive. By the same token, humanizing maternity services is not 
					retrogressive but post-modern and progressive. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Every change in the human condition, including development, has the 
					potential for positive and negative effects. The positive effects of 
					development overwhelm the negative effects until a level is reached 
					where social and economic benefits reach everyone, then hidden 
					negative effects begin to emerge. The data are overwhelming that 
					social and economic development, most especially maternal education, 
					brings down the infant mortality rate. But such development also 
					increases the rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or "cot 
					death") by bringing "modern" ways such as parental smoking and how 
					the infant is placed for sleeping, factors associated with SIDS. So 
					in highly developed places such as the Czech Republic SIDS rates 
					are lower in less developed rural areas than in Czech cities and 
					in Hong Kong SIDS rates are lower among the less developed families 
					still following traditional Chinese ways. (2) The negative effects 
					of development on infant mortality, always there, have now emerged. 
                </p>
                <p>
					The negative effects of development on maternal mortality are also 
					emerging. Obstetric interventions such as caesarean section sometimes 
					save lives and sometimes kills--- maternal mortality even for elective 
					(non-emergency) caesarean section is 2.84 fold or nearly three times 
					higher than for vaginal birth. (3) For fifty years the maternal 
					mortality ratio in the US came down. Then in the 1980's the maternal 
					mortality ratio began to rise and, according to the US Centers for 
					Disease Control and Prevention, it rose from 7.2 in 1987 to 10.0 in 
					1990. (4) While this ratio continued to decline in other industrialized 
					countries, in the US the maternal death rate continued a slow but 
					steady rise through the 1990s and according to the World Health 
					Organization is now higher than at least twenty other highly 
					industrialized countries. (5) 
                </p>
                <p>
					Because WHO relied heavily in the past on obstetricians from highly 
					developed countries with little or no experience in developing 
					countries, their programs tended to emphasize the role of doctors 
					in birth care. This is a double edged sword---when Safe Motherhood 
					Programs started in Brazil, it was gratifying to see maternal 
					mortality fall significantly but meanwhile caesarean section rates 
					soared, even in the poorest States. (see below)
                </p>
                <p>
					Obstetricians often claim the use of "high tech" medicalized 
					maternity care in rich countries is real progress but the 
					scientific evidence suggests it is sometimes otherwise. There 
					has been no significant improvement in highly industrialized 
					countries the past 20 years in low birth weight rates or cerebral 
					palsy rates. The slight fall in the perinatal mortality rate the 
					past 10 years in these countries is due, not to any fall in fetal 
					mortality, but only to a slight improvement in neonatal mortality 
					associated with neonatal intensive care and not with obstetric 
					care. In highly developed countries, all attempts to show lower 
					perinatal mortality rates with higher obstetric intervention rates 
					have failed. A US National Center for Health Statistics study 
					comments: "The comparisons of perinatal mortality ratios with 
					cesarean section and with operative vaginal rates finds no consistent 
					correlation's across countries". (6) A review of the scientific 
					literature on this issue by the Oxford National Perinatal 
					Epidemiology Unit states: "A number of studies have failed to 
					detect any relation between crude perinatal mortality rates and 
					the level of operative deliveries". (7) 
                </p>
                <p>
					This suggests that we are now at the point in maternity care in 
					industrialized countries where the positive effects of development 
					and technology are approaching the maximum and the negative effects 
					are surfacing. This helps to explain why advances in technology and 
					in development cannot lead to improvements in health unless the 
					technology is in harmony with natural biological processes and is 
					accompanied by humanized health care. Here a simple example. If an 
					elective caesarean section is done after labour has started, it may 
					in some cases facilitate natural processes. But waiting until labour 
					starts means doctors lose the possibility of scheduling the procedure 
					at their convenience. But if, as is almost always the case today, the 
					doctor tries to circumvent natural processes by performing elective 
					caesarean section before labour starts, there is a greater risk of 
					respiratory distress syndrome and prematurity, both leading killers 
					of newborn infants. We override nature at our peril.
                </p>
                <p>
					All of this helps to explain why international development agencies 
					such as the World Bank are now acknowledging that economic development 
					cannot lead to improvements in the human condition unless accompanied 
					by social development, including education. 
                </p>
                <p>
					The greatest danger with Western, medicalized management of birth is 
					its widespread export to developing countries. Scientific evidence 
					shows giving routine IV infusion to every woman in labour is 
					unnecessary but such a practice in a rich country, while a waste 
					of money, is not a tragedy. But I have seen such routine IV infusion 
					during labour in small rural district hospitals in developing 
					countries where the same hospitals have so little money they are 
					reusing disposable syringes. Routine IV infusion during labour in 
					developing countries is a tragic waste of extremely limited resources. 
					When developing countries adopt Western obstetric practices which are 
					not evidence based, the result is other women in those countries dying 
					of cancer not found early enough because of lack of attention and 
					funds for such unglamorous but essential care as outreach cancer 
					screening programs for poor women.
                </p>
                <p>
					Obstetricians, like all clinicians, work hard to help one patient at 
					a time. In balancing efficacy and risks, doctors desire to help puts 
					the focus on efficacy rather than risks. For example, in US 
					publications there are 41 randomized controlled trials (RCT) on 
					misoprostol (cytotec) for labour induction proving efficacy but not 
					a single RCT is large enough to adequately measure risks. (8) So the 
					Cochrane Library recommends not using midoprostol for this purpose. 
					(9) But it works and is easy and cheap so it is used widely in the US, 
					even though not approved by the FDA for this purpose. Now research is 
					emerging showing serious risks for using misoprostol for cervical 
					ripening or labour induction in women with a uterine scar. (10,11) 
					But it is too late for the many US women with previous caesarean 
					section whose uterus ruptured after induction with misoprostol and 
					their many dead babies. So misoprostol for labour induction on women 
					with previous caesarean section in the 1990s joins prenatal X-ray 
					pelvimetry in the 1930s, di-ethyl-stillbesterol (DES) for pregnant 
					women in the 1950s and thalidomide for pregnant women in the 1970s 
					as examples of obstetric interventions which have had tragic 
					consequences because they went into widespread use before adequate 
					scientific evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
					Behind these misunderstandings in interpreting scientific data is the 
					reality that most practicing doctors have little or no training in 
					science. Furthermore, there is a fundamental difference between the 
					practice of science and the practice of medicine. To generate 
					hypotheses, scientists must believe they don't know while practicing 
					doctors, to have the confidence to make life and death decisions, must 
					believe they do know. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Most clinicians also have little or no training in public health and 
					epidemiology and cannot understand how population based scientific 
					data applies to individual patients, resulting in, for example, 
					publishing in prominent clinical journals objections to using 
					recommended rates for cesarean section. (12) This failure of some 
					clinicians to understand public health and epidemiology is too often 
					combined with the failure of public health professionals to confront 
					clinicians regarding excesses in clinical practice because of their 
					fear of the power of clinicians and their loyalty to colleagues in 
					the same profession. (13) 
                </p>
                <p>
					For guidance in practices, clinicians in most places still rely on 
					peer review and community standards of practice. Using fellow doctors 
					as a central element in developing and monitoring practice guidelines 
					predictably has failed, in large part due to loyalties to professional 
					colleagues. "Community standards of practice", based on leading 
					clinicians practices on individual patients, still are the gold 
					standard even though they have been revealed as nothing more than 
					"that's what we all do" leading to a lowest common denominator 
					standard of care rather than a best care standard based on evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
					The one approach clinicians can understand is single case, anecdotal 
					evidence. This approach leads to the "what if" scenario in which 
					applying population data to their practices is rejected by clinicians 
					because "what if" this or that goes wrong with an individual patient. 
					There is no better example of this than planned out-of-hospital birth. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Many clinicians and their organizations continue to believe in the 
					dangers of planned out-of-hospital birth, either in a center birth or 
					at home, rejecting the overwhelming evidence that planned 
					out-of-hospital birth for low risk women is safe. The clinician's 
					response to this evidence is "But what if there is an out-of-hospital 
					birth and something happens?" Since most clinicians have never 
					attended an out-of-hospital birth, their "what if" question contains 
					several false assumptions. The first assumption is that in birth 
					things happen fast. In fact, with very few exceptions. things happen 
					slowly during labour and birth and a true emergency when seconds count 
					is extremely rare and, as we will see below, often in these cases the 
					midwife in the birth center or home can take care of the emergency. 
                </p>
                <p>
					The second false assumption, that when trouble develops there is 
					nothing an out-of-hospital midwife can do, can only be made by someone 
					who has never observed midwives at out-of-hospital births. A trained 
					midwife can anticipate trouble and usually prevent it from happening 
					in the first place as she is providing constant one-on-one care to the 
					birthing woman, unlike in the hospital where usually nurses or 
					midwives can only look in occasionally on the several women in labour 
					for which they are responsible. If trouble does develop, with few 
					exceptions the out-of-hospital midwife can do everything which can 
					be done in the hospital including giving oxygen, etc. For example, 
					when a baby’s head comes out but the shoulders get stuck, there is 
					nothing which can be done in the hospital except certain maneuvers 
					of the woman and baby, all of which can be done just as well by the 
					out-of-hospital midwife. The most recent successful maneuver for such 
					shoulder dystocia reported in the medical literature is named after 
					the home birth midwife who first described it (Gaskin maneuver). (14)
                </p>
                <p>
					The third false assumption is there can be faster action in the 
					hospital. The truth is that in most private care the woman's doctor 
					is not even in the hospital most of the time during her labour and 
					must be called in by the nurse when trouble develops. The doctor 
					"transport time" is as much as the "transport time" of a woman 
					having a birth center or home birth. Even in hospital births, when 
					a cesarean section is indicated, it takes on average 30 minutes for 
					the hospital to set up for surgery, locate the anesthesiologist, etc. 
					In one study of 117 hospital births with emergency cesarean section 
					for fetal distress, 52% of cases had a decision--incision time of over 
					30 minutes. (15) So during this 30 minutes either the doctor or the 
					out-of-hospital birthing woman are in transit to the hospital. This 
					is why it is important for a good collaborative relationship between 
					the out-of-hospital midwife and the hospital so when the midwife calls 
					the hospital to inform them of the transport, the hospital will waste 
					no time in making arrangements for the incoming birthing woman. These 
					are the reasons there are no data whatsoever to support the single 
					case, anecdotal "what if" scenario used by some doctors to scare 
					the public and politicians about out-of-hospital birth.
                </p>
                <p>
					Recently there is a desirable movement towards basing medical 
					practice on evidence and many obstetricians work hard to bring 
					their practices in line with the latest evidence. But still today 
					many doctors are not familiar with recent evidence nor with the means 
					to obtain it. In a 1998 British study 76% of practicing physicians 
					surveyed were aware of the concept of evidence based practice, but 
					only 40% believe that evidence is very applicable to their practice, 
					only 27% were familiar with methods of critical literature review and, 
					faced with a difficult clinical problem, the majority would first 
					consult another doctor rather than the evidence. (16) This helps 
					explain the continuing gap between clinical practices and the 
					evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
					Although obstetric care is gradually becoming more evidence based, 
					there is a tendency not to evaluate obstetric interventions for their 
					subtle and/or long term risks. For example, evidence suggests an 
					increasing incidence of certain neurological problems such as 
					attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and autism. While attempts 
					are being made to find causes for these problems, I know of no 
					attempt to determine any correlation's with simultaneously increasing 
					obstetric interventions such as prenatal ultrasound scanning, 
					pharmacological labour induction, epidural block for normal labour 
					pain, elective CS. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Another reason for the gap between evidence and practice is the 
					excuses given by some physicians for why they reject evidence in 
					their medical practice. These excuses include: the evidence is out 
					of date; collecting evidence is too slow and prevents progress; I
					use clinical judgment and my experience; using anecdotal "horror 
					stories" to try to prove the need for an intervention which the 
					evidence has found unnecessary; quoting evidence which is of poor 
					and/or inadequate quality; "trust me, I am a doctor"; "stop 
					doctor-bashing"; evidence erodes physician autonomy. In addition 
					to these excuses, in maternity care common excuses include: our 
					women have smaller pelvises (no evidence), our babies are getting 
					bigger (no evidence), our population is not as homogenous (no 
					evidence). 
                </p>
                <p>
					Some obstetricians, as members of society, tend to blind faith in 
					technology and the mantra: technology = progress = modern. The other 
					side of the coin is the lack of faith in nature, best expressed by a 
					Canadian obstetrician: "Nature is a bad obstetrician." So the idea 
					is to conquer nature and results in the widespread application of 
					attempts to improve on nature before scientific evaluation. This has 
					led to a series of failed attempts in the twentieth century to improve 
					on biological and social evolution. Doctors replaced midwives for low 
					risk births, then science proved midwives safer. Hospital replaced 
					home for low risk birth, then science proved home as safe with far 
					less unnecessary intervention. Hospital staff replaced family as birth 
					support, then science proved birth safer if family present. Lithotomy 
					replaced vertical birth positions, then science proved vertical 
					positions safer. Newborn examinations away from mothers in the first 
					20 minutes replaced leaving babies with mothers, then science proved 
					the necessity for maternal attachment during this time. Man-made milk 
					replaced woman-made milk, then science proved breast milk superior. 
					The central nursery replaced the mother, then science proved 
					rooming-in superior. If more doctors experienced an earthquake or 
					volcano, they would realize their ideas of controlling nature are 
					nothing more than stories to rewrite insignificance.
                </p>
                <h3>
					UNNECESSARY CAESAREAN SECTION: SYMBOL OF DEHUMANIZATION 
				</h3>
                <p>
					The quintessential example of medicalization and dehumanization of 
					birth is unnecessary caesarean section (CS) in which the surgeon is 
					in charge and the woman no longer has any control. CS saves lives but 
					there is no evidence that rising CS rates the past two decades in many 
					countries has improved birth outcomes. (6,7) How can this be? As 
					indications for CS broaden and rates go up, lives are saved in a 
					smaller and smaller proportion of all CS cases. But the risks of 
					this major surgical procedure do not decrease with increasing rates. 
					It is only logical that eventually a rate is reached at which CS kills 
					almost as many babies as it saves. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Women and their babies are currently paying a big price for the 
					promotion of CS by some doctors. The scientific data on maternal 
					mortality associated with CS suggest the rising maternal mortality 
					rates in the US and Brazil may be, at least in part, the result of 
					their high CS rates. (3 ) Both these countries need to carefully 
					audit all maternal deaths to test the strong hypothesis that rising 
					rates of maternal death are associated with high rates of caesarean 
					section. The data on other risks for both woman and baby associated 
					with CS mean both are paying a big price both in the current birth 
					and in future pregnancies as well. (17 ) 
                </p>
                <p>
					So why so much unnecessary CS? When maternity care is controlled by 
					doctors and midwives are marginalized or absent, higher CS rates are 
					found. Many studies have shown lower obstetric intervention rates when 
					midwives attend low risk birth than when doctors are providing primary 
					birth care to low risk women. (18 ) It is no coincidence that in the 
					US, Canada and urban Brazil, where obstetricians attend the majority 
					of normal births and there are few midwives attending few births, the 
					highest CS rates in the world are found. Having a highly trained 
					gynecological surgeon attend a normal birth is analogous to having a 
					pediatric surgeon baby-sit a normal two-year old child. It would be a 
					waste of the pediatric surgeon's time and skills and, when the young 
					child gets tired and fussy, the surgeon might be tempted 
					inappropriately to use drugs, where a properly trained baby-sitter 
					would soothe the baby with a variety of non-medical techniques---the 
					medicalization of normal childhood similar to the medicalization of 
					normal birth. High CS rates are a symbol of the lack of humanization 
					of birth.
                </p>
                <p>
					The overuse of elective CS and other unnecessary obstetric 
					interventions also threatens the larger community. Not even the 
					richest countries in the world have the financial resources to 
					transplant all the hearts, dialyze all the kidneys, give new hips 
					to all the people who might benefit from these procedures. Choices 
					must be made about which medical and surgical treatments to fund and 
					these choices will determine who shall live. A CS which is done 
					without any medical indication but only because a woman chooses 
					it requires a surgeon, possibly a second doctor to assist, an 
					anesthesiologist, surgical nurses, equipment, an operating theatre, 
					blood ready for transfusion if necessary, a longer post-operative
					hospital stay, etc. This costs a great deal of money and, equally 
					importantly, a great deal of training of health personnel, most of 
					which is at government expense, even if the CS is done by a private 
					physician in a private hospital. If a woman receives an elective CS 
					simply because she prefers it, there will be less human and financial 
					resources for the rest of health care. 
                </p>
                <p>
					This dangerous drain on financial resources, as noted earlier, is far 
					greater when CS practices in places like the US are exported to 
					developing countries with far fewer resources for health services. 
					For example, in one State in Brazil 59 hospitals have CS rates over 
					80%, three health districts have CS rates over 70% while an additional 
					13 health districts have CS rates over 60% and the entire State has a 
					CS rate of 47.7%. (19) Clearly this is a huge drain on Brazil's 
					limited health resources. And the women of Brazil also are paying 
					another price. The data given above proving the higher maternal 
					mortality with elective CS in the UK is further substantiated by 
					data showing a recent rise in maternal mortality rates in those 
					areas of Brazil with these shockingly high CS rates.(20) CS on 
					demand is an expensive and dangerous luxury.
                </p>
                <p>
					In the light of these issues, the Committee for the Ethical Aspects 
					of Human Reproduction and Women's Health of FIGO (the international 
					umbrella organization of national obstetric organizations) states in 
					a 1999 report: "Performing cesarean section for non-medical reasons 
					is ethically not justified." (21 ) And there are individual 
					obstetricians and some medical organizations working to bring down 
					CS rates and humanize birth.

					SOLUTIONS
				</h3>
                <p>
					So far we have not been clever enough, in developed or developing 
					countries, to take the advantages of medicalized birth care while 
					avoiding the disadvantages such as the drift to obstetric excesses. 
					Humanizing birth has the potential to combine the advantages of 
					Western medicalized birth with the advantages of redirecting the 
					care so as to honor the biological, social, cultural and spiritual 
					nature of human birth. There are several strategies for humanization 
					of birth---- strategies which will put the woman and the family back 
					in control of the birth of their own child while empowering the woman 
					to believe in herself through experiencing what her own body can 
					accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
					The first strategy is education. Those who control information hold 
					the power. In the past the medical profession often has maintained 
					control of medical care through protecting and withholding information. 
					Patient confidentiality, a legitimate excuse for limiting access to 
					information on individual patients, is now understood not to be an 
					excuse for limiting information on grouped data such as hospital data 
					and community data. The information revolution is profoundly changing 
					medical care. The advent of the internet and world wide web is having 
					a profound effect on bringing medical information to everyone. In the 
					new millenium a global movement is demanding accountable and 
					transparent health care practitioners and health care facilities 
					(including hospitals) as a basic requirement of any democracy. 
					Complete and honest information must be given to the public, even 
					when it means giving up power and, in some cases, can be dangerous 
					to the continuation of certain practices----maternal mortality rates 
					a prime example. 
                </p>
                <p>
					Full information on the good and bad results of medicalized birth must 
					be given to health care practitioners, public health officials, 
					politicians and the public. In other words, everyone must begin to 
					see the water that many doctors and hospitals are swimming in and see 
					that in many cases it is full of sharks which may not eat the doctors 
					but may sometimes eat women and babies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need to broaden the horizon of doctors concerning maternity care 
					is not a new problem. In a medical book published in the year 1668 is 
					the statement: "Doctors who have never seen a home birth and yet feel 
					competent to argue against it resemble those geographers who give us 
					the description of many countries which they never saw." We must start 
					by requiring doctors to look at the water in which modern maternity 
					care exists in order to get a physiological standard against which 
					they can measure all their experiences. In an obstetric training 
					program in The Philippines, every doctor must attend a minimum number 
					of planned home births. Every obstetric training program should 
					require visits to planned out-of-hospital births, including birth 
					centers and home births. Midwives and obstetric nurses in training 
					need the same experience. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The education of women, especially pregnant women, is of paramount 
					importance but here the issues is: what are the women told. In some 
					places prenatal education programs are controlled by a few 
					obstetricians who insist on giving only doctor-friendly information 
					to pregnant women. Many anesthesiologists in the US have managed to 
					gain access to prenatal classes where they preach the wonders of 
					epidural block and usually say nothing about the considerable risks 
					of this invasive procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					More recently, for some doctors to succeed in promoting women 
					choosing cesarean sections for which there are no medical indications 
					it is necessary to provide limited, highly selected information. (17 ) 
					It is highly unlikely women would ever consider choosing CS if they 
					were given the full scientific evidence on the risks for themselves 
					and their babies. The key ethical issue is not the right to choose or 
					demand a major surgical procedure for which there is no medical 
					indication but the right to receive and discuss full, unbiased 
					information prior to any medical or surgical procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					A liberated woman correctly strives not to be controlled by men, an 
					effort even more difficult if she lives in a male chauvinist society. 
					There are many ways in which women giving birth in hospitals in "macho" 
					cultures are oppressed and given the message that they are not 
					important and not free but controlled by an often belligerent 
					staff ---for example they are told not to scream or make loud noise 
					with labour contractions.
				</p>
				<p>
					But if a woman accepts the medicalized, male dominated obstetric 
					model of care with its selected information, she gives up any chance 
					to control her own body and make true choices. Volumes have been 
					written about how liberating and empowering it is for a woman to 
					give birth when she controls what happens. Without fully informed 
					choice, she will give up any control and comply with the wishes of 
					the doctors and hospitals. Women who demand choice but get only 
					selected doctor-friendly information unwittingly buy into the medical 
					position. Sadly a few feminists who correctly fight for women's rights 
					have been drawn into believing biased doctor-friendly information and 
					as a result have unwittingly promoted the right of women to demand 
					obstetric procedures which are dangerous to them and their babies.
				</p>
				<p>
					A second strategy for humanization of birth is the promotion of 
					evidence based maternity care practices. As mentioned earlier, using 
					peer review and community standards of practice has failed to close 
					the gap between present obstetric practices and the evidence. And in 
					many places public health professionals and government agencies have 
					failed to aggressively pursue closing the gap between obstetric 
					practices and evidence, often out of fear of the power of the medical 
					establishment. (13)
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been an interesting and educational exercise for me to come 
					to hospital obstetric units and present to the staff a simple table 
					with their own rates of interventions ( induction, episiotomy, 
					lithotomy, operative vaginal, cesarean section) in a column on the 
					left and the evidence based rates opposite in a column on the right. 
					The ensuing discussion is often characterized by more heat than light, 
					always with at least a few doctors as concerned as I about the gap 
					between their practices and the evidence. As we enter the era of 
					post- modern medical care, the GOBSAT (Good Old Boys Sit Around 
					Table) clinical practice guidelines of yore, royalist in sentiment 
					and pompous in tone, will be replaced by evidence based practice 
					guidelines approved by the community. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another essential strategy in humanizing birth is: who is the primary 
					care giver for women during pregnancy and birth. The tradition of 
					doctors insisting on controlling their own practices with little or 
					no interference from the community or its representatives goes back 
					a long time. During the course of the twentieth century, the practice 
					of doctors going on "house calls" disappeared. As long as doctors 
					provide primary care to normal, healthy pregnant and birthing women, 
					women will not be in control and humanization of maternity care will 
					not happen. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Countries must work hard not to allow doctors from places with highly 
					medicalized maternity care like the US to come and try to sell the 
					country the visiting doctors own system of maternity care, a system 
					where nearly every obstetrician and maternity hospital offers only 
					one style of birth care---a style not based on scientific evidence 
					but on the absolute control of the system by the doctors. Maternity 
					care in the US, is a form of care with extreme medicalization. 
					Doctors give primary care to over 90 % of normal, healthy women 
					giving birth. As a result, birth has become a surgical procedure 
					with high rates of unnecessary interventions. Women giving birth are 
					disempowered and there are huge wastes of resources, financial and 
					professional. Twice as much is spent per capita on maternity care 
					as any other country and midwives are marginalized. This is not a 
					system to emulate---the US maternal mortality rate, perinatal 
					mortality rate and infant mortality rate are much higher than the 
					rates in nearly every other industrialized country.
				</p>
				<p>
					By contrast, midwifery has a long tradition of placing the birthing 
					woman in the center with all the control in the woman's hands and 
					with the midwife providing the kind of support which will empower 
					the woman and strengthen the family. For this reason, having primary 
					maternity care in the hands of midwives is a central strategy in 
					humanization of birth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Countries might want to study the maternity care in countries much 
					further along the road to humanization such as New Zealand, The 
					Netherlands, Scandinavian countries. In these countries, over 80% 
					of women see only midwives during pregnancy and birth (in or out of 
					hospital) and they have some of the lowest maternal and perinatal 
					mortality rates in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Considerable scientific research has demonstrated four major 
					advantages to autonomous midwifery: midwives are safer for low 
					risk birth, midwives use less unnecessary interventions, midwives 
					are cheaper, midwives provide more satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, there can no longer be any doubt that midwives are the safest 
					birth attendant for low risk birth. One meta-analysis of 15 studies 
					comparing midwife-attended birth with physician attended birth found 
					no difference in outcomes for women or babies except for fewer low 
					birth weight babies with midwives. (22 ) Two randomized controlled 
					trials (RCT) in Scotland (23,24) and 6 RCTs in North America all 
					found no increase in adverse outcomes with midwife attended birth. 
					(18)
				</p>
				<p>
					The most definitive study of the safety of midwife attended birth, 
					published in 1998, looked at all births in one year in the US---over 
					four million births. Selecting only singleton, vaginal births and 
					removing cases of social or medical risk factors, they compared 
					outcomes between midwife-attended births and physician attended 
					births. Compared with physician attended births, midwife attended 
					births had 19% lower infant mortality, 33% lower neonatal mortality 
					and 31% lower low birth weight rates. (25)
				</p>
				<p>
					After reviewing the extensive evidence for the safety of midwives, a 
					recent article in an obstetric journal concludes: "A search of the 
					scientific literature fails to uncover a single study demonstrating 
					poorer outcomes with midwives than with physicians for low-risk 
					women----evidence shows primary care by midwives to be as safe or 
					safer than care by physicians." (18). 
				</p>
				<p>
					The second advantage of midwives over doctors as primary birth 
					attendants is a drastic reduction in rates of unnecessary invasive 
					interventions. Scientific evidence shows that, compared to physician 
					attended birth, midwife attended birth has statistically 
					significantly: less amniotomy, less IV fluids or IV medication, less 
					routine electronic fetal monitoring, less use of narcotics, less use 
					of anesthesia including epidural block for labour pain, less induction 
					and augmentation, less episiotomy, less forceps and vacuum extraction, 
					less cesarean section, more vaginal birth after cesarean section. (18) 
				</p>
				<p>
					The third advantage of using midwives as the principal birth attendant 
					for most births is cost savings. While it varies from country to 
					country, midwives salaries are almost always considerably less than 
					doctor's salaries. And of course, the lower intervention rates with 
					midwives mean major cost savings. The data on cost saving is reviewed 
					in a paper on midwifery in industrialized countries (18) where, for 
					example, one study found a cost saving of US $500 for every case 
					where a midwife is birth attendant. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another advantage of midwifery care, often disparaged by advocates of 
					medicalized birth, is the pregnant and birthing woman's satisfaction 
					with her care. The midwifery approach emphasizes the importance of 
					women's satisfaction. The evidence in the literature is overwhelming: 
					midwifery care is statistically significantly more satisfying to the 
					woman and her family. (18)
				</p>
				<p>
					Since hospitals are doctor territory and no woman has ever been in 
					control of her own care in a hospital setting, another important 
					strategy for humanization of birth is to move birth out of the 
					hospital. There have always been and always will be women everywhere 
					who choose planned home birth and need a midwife to attend the birth. 
					But today, as a result of decades of propaganda about how dangerous 
					birth is, told by doctors who are themselves afraid of birth and are 
					told how safe hospital birth is, told by doctors who themselves need 
					the security of hospitals, there are many women who have bought into 
					the myth that home birth is dangerous.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unbelievable that obstetric organizations in some highly 
					industrialized countries such as the US still have the same official 
					policy against home birth which they wrote in the 1970's. At that time 
					planned home birth was not separated from unplanned precipitous 
					out-of-hospital birth which, of course, had high mortality due to 
					preemies born in taxis, etc. Then when scientists separated out 
					planned home birth, it proved to have perinatal mortality rates as 
					low or lower than low risk hospital birth. A large scientific 
					literature documents this, including when the home birth practitioner 
					is a nurse midwife (26) or when it is a direct entry midwife (27-29). 
					A meta-analysis of the safety of home birth, published in 1997, 
					conclusively demonstrates the safety of home birth and includes an 
					excellent review of the literature. (30)
				</p>
				<p>
					So the real issue with home birth is not safety but the issues are 
					freedom and sanctity of the family. For the over eighty percent of 
					women who have had no serious medical complications during pregnancy, 
					planned home birth is a perfectly safe choice. Any doctor, hospital 
					or medical organization attempting to discourage a low risk woman 
					from choosing home birth is denying basic human rights by withholding 
					full unbiased information and limiting a woman's freedom of choice of 
					place of birth. The birth of a baby is one of the most important 
					events in the life of the family and when the family chooses a 
					planned home birth, the sanctity of the family must be honored. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of the frightening propaganda of many in the obstetrical 
					profession about how dangerous birth is, many women want the freedom 
					to control their own birthing but need the 'security' of an 
					institution. How can women today be in control of giving birth and 
					be empowered by birth and be assisted by a midwife and still feel 
					comfortable and protected by an institution? By choosing an 
					alternative birth center (ABC) which is 'free-standing' (i.e. 
					out-of-hospital) and staffed by midwives. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The first essential characteristic of an ABC is that it is free of 
					any control by a hospital. A hospital which claims to have a 'birth 
					center' is like a bakery which claims to sell 'home-baked' bread. 
					To be a birth center, the birthing woman must be in control of 
					everything that happens to her and her baby. This means the ABC 
					should be staffed by midwives using protocols made by midwives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The type of care provided in an ABC is quite different from a 
					hospital. In a hospital the doctor is always in absolute control 
					while in an ABC the woman is in control. In the hospital the emphasis 
					is on routines while in the ABC the emphasis is on individuality and 
					informed choice. Hospital protocols are designed with all the possible 
					complications in mind while ABC protocols focus on normality, 
					screening and observation. In hospitals pain is define as an evil 
					to be stamped out with drugs while in the ABC it is understood that 
					labour pain has a physiological function and can be relieved with 
					scientifically proven, non-pharmacological methods such as immersion 
					in water, changing position and moving about, massage, presence of 
					family, continuous presence of the same birth attendant. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the hospital induction is frequent and uses powerful drugs which 
					increase the pain and has many risks while in the ABC labour is 
					stimulated with non-pharmacological methods including walking and 
					sexual stimulation such as massage of the nipples. In the hospital 
					staff are not always present but come and go and change every eight 
					hours while in the ABC there is the continuous presence of one midwife 
					throughout the labour. In the hospital the new baby is taken away from 
					the mother for various reasons such as doing a newborn examination 
					while in the ABC the new baby is never taken from the mother.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are ABCs a safe place for a woman to give birth if she has had no 
					complications during the pregnancy? This is a key question because 
					in the struggle between the medicalized and humanized approaches to 
					maternity care, the ABC is a big threat to doctors and hospitals and 
					the industry producing all the obstetric technologies. Because 
					medicalized birth is so expensive with costly hospital stay, highly 
					paid obstetricians using so much costly high tech intervention, the 
					doctors and hospitals must convince the public and those who control 
					funding of health services that their way is the only safe way. 
					Otherwise they will quickly lose much of their business. So obstetric 
					organizations usually fight against all birth where they are not in 
					control. Their first line of defense against any planned 
					out-of-hospital birth is to label it unsafe. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The only way to determine if ABCs are safe is to turn to the 
					scientific evidence. A thorough review of the scientific evidence 
					on ABCs (31) reports that in the 1970s and 1980s there were a number 
					of descriptive studies on ABCs. Then in 1989 a most important paper 
					on ABCs was published: "The US National Birth Center Study" involving 
					84 ABCs and 11,814 births. (32) In the 1990s seven more studies 
					compared ABC birth with hospital birth and one RCT was reported. 
					The results of this research follows.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regarding safety, the US National Birth Center Study had no maternal 
					mortality and an intrapartum and neonatal mortality rate of 1.3 per 
					1000 live births, a rate comparable to the rates in low risk hospital 
					births. The infant mortality rate and Apgar scores in the ABCs was 
					also comparable to low risk hospital rates. Sixteen percent of ABC 
					births were transferred to the hospital. Such rates of transfer of 
					planned ABC birth to hospital because of complications compare 
					favorably with the number of planned hospital births which are 
					transferred to the surgical suite because of complications. The 
					intention to treat analysis was used in which all complications, 
					interventions and outcomes from ABC births transferred to hospital 
					are included in the ABC statistics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The safety of ABC birth is further substantiated by additional 
					studies done in the 1990s in which the outcomes of ABC 
					births---perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, apgar scores, 
					low birth weight rates---in all studies were as good or better than 
					the outcomes with hospital birth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the evidence for the safety of ABCs, these studies had 
					further data on the characteristics of women choosing ABCs. After 
					their ABC birth was over, 99% said they would recommend ABC birth 
					to their friends and 94% said they would return themselves to the 
					ABC for any future births. A RCT found that 63% of ABC women had an 
					increase in self-esteem while 18 % of women with hospital birth had 
					an increase in self-esteem. (31)
				</p>
				<p>
					With regard to the promotion of breastfeeding, studies in the US, 
					Denmark and Sweden all found significantly increased rates of 
					successful breast-feeding in ABC women.
				</p>
				<p>
					The review of literature on ABCs (31) compared a number of obstetrical 
					intervention rates in the US National Birth Center Study with the 
					rates of obstetrical intervention in all hospitals in one State 
					(Illinois). In ABCs, 99% were spontaneous vaginal births compared 
					to 55% of hospital births. Less than 4% of ABC births had induction 
					or augmentation with artificial rupture of membranes and/or oxytocin 
					compared with 40% of hospital births. Routine electronic fetal 
					monitoring was done in 8% of ABC births and 95% of hospital births. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Regional or general anesthesia (including epidural block) was done in 
					13% of ABC births and 42% of hospital births. Operative vaginal birth 
					(forceps or vacuum) was done in less than 1% of ABC births and 10% of 
					hospital births. Cesarean section was done in less than 5% of ABC 
					births and in 21% of hospital births. Looking at these comparisons 
					of interventions, clearly the logical question is not if ABC birth 
					is safe but if hospital birth is safe.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the news about the safety of ABCs spreads, more and more are being 
					established. In the past ten years, Germany has gone from having one 
					ABC to now having over 50 ABCs. In Japan, a network of midwife birth 
					houses provided a significant part of maternity services the first 
					half of the last century but during the American occupation, US Army 
					doctors and nurses put pressure on the Japanese to close the birth 
					houses. Now, however, there is a resurgence of birth houses in Japan. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Compared to hospital births, home births and births in ABC's are 
					safe, much cheaper, use far less unnecessary interventions, are more 
					satisfying to the woman and family. In other words, out-of-hospital 
					birth is an important strategy in humanizing birth care. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another strategy in humanizing birth is to integrate out-of-hospital 
					and in-hospital birth care and practitioners. This was accomplished 
					with excellent results in Fortaleza Brazil with community based 
					traditional midwives collaborating closely with hospital 
					obstetricians. (33) This model program, which had gained world 
					wide recognition, was sadly eliminated when the visionary obstetrician 
					who established it died. Data from places like Australia show that 
					when home birth midwives and local hospital doctors collaborate, 
					fewer babies die and everyone learns from each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Birth is political. An essential strategy is for advocates of 
					humanized birth to be politically active. Politicians and government 
					agencies make crucial decisions about maternity care and their 
					education about and involvement in humanization of birth is 
					essential.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advocates of humanized birth must warn politicians and policy 
					makers of the use of scare tactics by some of the more reactionary 
					elements of the medical and nursing establishment who raise the 
					issue of safety and claim without a shred of evidence that humanized 
					birth is dangerous---that midwives are less safe than doctors and 
					out-of-hospital birth less safe than hospital birth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another common scare tactic is for some obstetricians to say that 
					every out-of-hospital birth transported to the hospital is a "train 
					wreck". The answer to this criticism is "of course". A competent 
					out-of-hospital midwife will only transport those few cases where 
					there is a serious problem requiring surgical interventions not 
					available in the home. So for the obstetricians who have never 
					attended a home birth (in many places this is nearly all 
					obstetricians), these out-of-hospital transports with problems 
					are their only experience with out-of-hospital birth and they 
					erroneously assume these cases are representative of all 
					out-of-hospital birth. This is like the auto mechanic who 
					sees several Mercedes with mechanical problems and concludes 
					all Mercedes are no good, forgetting that for every Mercedes he 
					sees in his shop, there are a thousand Mercedes running fine and 
					therefore not brought to his shop. This is why doctors need to 
					experience out-of-hospital birth first hand. 
				</p>
				<p>
					These scare tactics are motivated by the attempt of some doctors 
					(and sometimes even nurses) to protect maternity care as their 
					territory. Often doctors attempt to overwhelm legislators with 
					technical language which implies that only doctors can possibly 
					understand so the listener must simply "trust me, I’m a doctor". 
					Politicians and policy makers should be urged to ask those making 
					these scare statements "Please show me the scientific data to prove 
					what you are saying." It can also be illuminating for legislators to 
					ask those making scare statements how many out-of-hospital births 
					they have attended.
				</p>
				<h3>
					CONCLUSION 
				</h3>
				<p>
					The final solution is to evolve new social and political forms for 
					the medical profession and for medical care. And there are 
					obstetricians joining in the effort to find these new forms for 
					their profession. Maternity care needs turning around so that, 
					instead of drifting away from physiology and from the social and 
					cultural environment, the process moves toward respecting and 
					working with nature and with the woman and family, turning control 
					of medical care over to the people. For those who fear chaos, 
					remember Churchill's warning: democracy is the worst form of 
					government until one considers the alternatives. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This turn around has started in places with local public committees 
					deciding on health care policies and priorities---post- modern 
					maternity care. Everything about pregnancy and birth----how it 
					is perceived by society, how the pain of birth is endured by women, 
					how birth is ‘managed’ by birth attendants---are highly cultural. 
					Local control leads to empowerment of women which, in turn, leads 
					to a stronger family and society---local women need to give birth 
					in local waters. People have been swimming in the physiological, 
					social and cultural primordial sea for a long, long time, can see 
					the water, know where the sharks are and are adept at eventually 
					finding their way forward to reclaiming humanized birth.
