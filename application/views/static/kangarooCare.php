                <p>
                    Kangaroo care is the process of spending extended periods of time 
                    'wearing' your baby.  In its strictest form, the baby is held naked
                    (diapered) chest to chest between the mother's breasts.  In a modified 
                    version, often used for full term babies, the baby is simply held fully 
                    clothed most of the time in a baby sling or Snuggly against the 
                    mother's chest.  The idea is to provide a more gradual transition 
                    from womb to world.  The results are dramatic and include faster weight 
                    gain, better milk supply in the mother, less crying, less sleep apnea, 
                    easier temperature regulation in the newborn and most importantly a 
                    vastly increased sense of bonding between the newborn and the mother.

                    for preemies have been extensively studied.  However, every baby and 
                    parent will benefit from kangaroo care.

							Mother kangaroo is a mammal (just like us), and feeds its baby 
							milk like we do (or like we should!) from a nipple inside its 
							pouch.  The pouch covers the baby with skin, and this not only 
							protects the very immature baby, but also provides it with a 
							total environment which is essential for development. This 
							includes warmth, food, comfort, stimulation, protection. The 
							baby is CARRIED for all this time, without interruption !

							HUMAN KANGAROO MOTHER CARE does the same for the premature!  
							- Skin-to-skin contact - Breastfeeding - Protection
							<br/>
							Most mammals have young which are born able to fend for 
							themselves. The human baby is extremely immature compared 
							to such mammals, which is also the case for kangaroos, and 
							other "marsupials".  These similarities to marsupial care 
							is why we call it Kangaroo Care.  But it is the MOTHER which 
							is essential for the baby! For the human immature baby, the 
							mother's chest provides the essentials: warmth, breast milk, 
							comfort, stimulation and protection.  And so we prefer to 
							call it Kangaroo Mother Care or KMC
