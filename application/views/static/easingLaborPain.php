						What Does Labor Feel Like?
                    </h3>
                    From the intense, cramping pull or squeeze of the dilating contractions 
                    to the profound stretching sensation as the baby's head moves down the 
                    birth canal, labor is characterized by powerful feelings. Some women 
                    describe the dilating contractions in terms of a more familiar sensation--
                    a cramp, like a menstrual cramp; a charley horse; a gas pain; or a feeling 
                    of rectal pressure. One mother says her contractions were like "strong gas 
                    pains, tremendous pressure around the pubic area." Another describes labor 
                    as "huge waves, like diarrhea cramps, one after the other." Still another 
                    says, "My labor felt like extraordinarily severe menstrual cramps with a 
                    lot of pressure on the rectum, like constant pressure to have a bowel 
                    movement."
                    <br/><br/>
                    Confronting the intensity of pain before you give birth may motivate you to 
                    learn ways of dealing with it more adequately when you're actually in labor. 
                    In fact, a study published recently in Birth suggests that women with 
                    higher levels of fear before their first childbirth class actually reported 
                    less anxiety during labor and delivery. The authors concluded that these 
                    women probably had dealt with their concerns before they went into labor.
                    <br/><br/>
                    One woman, for example, coped with the pain by envisioning the purpose of 
                    each contraction: "I visualized my uterus rising up and pulling back, 
                    opening the cervix more and more with each contraction."

						Why Is Labor Painful?
                    </h3>
                    Now, painless labor is possible--Alice, who opened this chapter, certainly 
                    experienced one-- but it's quite rare and should always be considered an 
                    unexpected bonus.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Labor is usually painful for several very good reasons. For one, the 
                    cervix, completely insensitive to burning and cauterization, is 
                    nevertheless extremely sensitive to pressure and stretching--precisely 
                    what it undergoes during labor. Most women feel contractions as cramping 
                    sensations in the groin or back, though some experience more pain in their 
                    sides or thighs. As the contractions get longer, stronger, and closer 
                    together over the course of labor, they will be perceived as more or less 
                    painful by different women.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition, the uterine muscle--at term, the largest and strongest muscle 
                    in your body--may have to work at alternately contracting and relaxing for 
                    hour after hour. That can lead to a tired, achy feeling, just the way the 
                    voluntary muscles in your arms and legs might feel exhausted and sore after 
                    a difficult workout. The normal decrease in oxygen flow to the uterus as it 
                    contracts can add to that achy feeling.
                    <br/><br/>
                    During labor a lot of pressure may be exerted on the fallopian tubes, 
                    ovaries, and ligaments. The baby's presenting part (usually the head) 
                    presses firmly against your bladder and bowel as he descends through your 
                    pelvis. This can lead to great pain, particularly if you don't empty your 
                    bladder frequently. About once an hour is a good rule to remember.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The rectum usually empties itself ("nature's diarrhea") in early labor. If 
                    it doesn't, you may choose an enema to give your baby more room (see 
                    chapter 17). Whether your rectum is empty or not, the pressure of the 
                    baby's head on surrounding nerves will be surprising. This feels as though 
                    you are going to have a bowel movement right now. To some women, that 
                    feeling of rectal pressure is extremely painful.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When you are in the pushing or second stage of labor, you will probably 
                    feel an extraordinary sensation of stretching in your vagina. "I felt," 
                    said one mother, "as if I would burst." Birth is a normal function, of 
                    course, but it's hardly an everyday feeling.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Dr. Ronald Melzack, professor of psychology at McGill University and a 
                    noted pain researcher, helped develop the McGill Pain Questionnaire to 
                    answer just such questions. The McGill Pain Questionnaire characterizes 
                    different types of pain in terms of their distinctive attributes (like 
                    throbbing, burning, rhythmic, pounding, etc.) and also allows a rating of 
                    the intensity of any pain on a scale from "none" to .excruciating."
                    <br/><br/>
                    According to Melzack, "Labor is ... among the most severe pains that have 
                    been recorded with the McGill Pain Questionnaire." But while the average 
                    labor was indeed rated as very painful, women's scores ranged widely. A 
                    few mothers reported easy, almost pain-free labors while others 
                    experienced extremely difficult ones.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Whether or not a woman had had a baby before seemed to make a big 
                    difference. In an early study, Melzack and his associates queried 141 
                    women, 54 of whom had had a previous baby and 87 first-time mothers. One 
                    in four of the first-time mothers rated labor as horrible or excruciating, 
                    while only one in 11 of the experienced mothers rated their labors this 
                    harshly. The proportions were reversed at the bottom end of the range, 
                    with only one in 11 first-time mothers but one in four experienced mothers 
                    rating their labors as mild.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Also, change the meaning of the situation to make it more or less painful. 
                    One study, for example, showed that women who had previously experienced 
                    high levels of pain unrelated to childbirth reported less labor pain than 
                    other women.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Another recent study compared Dutch and American women giving birth. 
                    American women were much more likely to expect labor to be painful and to 
                    assume that they would need medication for it. They predicted correctly. 
                    Indeed, only one in six American women received no medication compared to 
                    almost two-thirds of the Dutch women.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The biggest difference among people, however, isn't in their perception 
                    of pain but in their ability and motivation to withstand it. In one 
                    experiment, for example, Jewish women increased their level of tolerance 
                    after they were told that their religious group had a lower pain tolerance 
                    than others.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It's well known that a person may have a low tolerance for pain in one 
                    situation, but a high tolerance in another. For example, soldiers whose 
                    severe wounds would warrant strong painkillers in a civilian population 
                    nevertheless denied feeling high levels of pain when they were interviewed 
                    away from the battleground. Athletes are often observed to continue 
                    playing despite injuries that a non-player probably would find quite 
                    painful.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Your pain threshold can also be lowered or raised by the type of 
                    attention you focus on a sensation. In one pain experiment, simply 
                    reading the word "pain" in the instructions made subjects find a low 
                    level of electric shock painful. They didn't report the same level of 
                    shock painful when the suggestive word "pain" was left out of the 
                    instructions. This, of course, is the reason childbirth teachers refer 
                    to "labor contractions" and not to "labor pains."
                    <br/><br/>
                    By the same token, if your anxiety is reduced instead of built up, your 
                    pain threshold may be increased. Another pain experiment gave subjects 
                    control over the painful stimulus, an electric shock. With a sense of 
                    control, subjects found the stimulus less painful, probably because they 
                    experienced less anxiety about what would happen to them.

					<h3>
						Reducing Labor Pain
					</h3>
					Because pain perception is so malleable, you can reduce the pain you 
					feel during labor in a variety of ways. You may be able to alter the 
					physical sensation itself, say, by changing your own position. Perhaps 
					you'll choose to intercept the pain message, closing the gate or jamming 
					the transmission of pain by sending competing soothing messages--
					counterpressure, massage, or TENS are but a few of the means to do this.
					<br/><br/>
					You'll probably also use many psychological methods of restructuring the 
					pain messages, like tuning into your body and employing positive imagery 
					to reinterpret painful sensations as "opening" or "the baby descending." 
					You can soothe yourself with attention-focusing devices such as 
					relaxation, slowed breathing, and music; and you can supply yourself with 
					calming sights to look at, and special companions to comfort you. Perhaps 
					you'll choose to concentrate on so-called left-brain (rational) activities
					--counting to yourself, pacing or patterning your breathing, focusing on a 
					particular picture, or listening to your partner count time on a watch. 
					Practicing lots of strategies and being flexible about changing strategies 
					midstream can help you get through the painful contractions and prevent 
					you from tensing up in anticipation of future pain.
					<br/><br/>
					All these techniques represent merely the tip of the iceberg of methods 
					you can use to lessen the pain of birth. Many ways exist to respond to the 
					challenge of bringing a new life into the world, and we'll explore a good 
					number of them in detail. With education, practice, and commitment, you'll 
					be well equipped to help yourself alleviate pain and get the most out of 
					your birth experience.
					<br/><br/>
					How do you picture yourself during labor? Perhaps you've imagined 
					yourself getting into bed, pulling up the covers, and simply lying there 
					awaiting your baby's birth. Your husband mops your face with a wet 
					washcloth while doctors and nurses flutter around your bedside. This image 
					bears little resemblance to reality. If you really want to have your baby 
					more quickly and with less pain, plan to get up and keep moving around as 
					long as you can through labor. Since having a baby requires active 
					participation on your part, you may want to prepare yourself to help the 
					process by engaging in an exercise program during pregnancy. In your 
					childbirth preparation class you'll probably learn several stretches to 
					promote good posture and the proper functioning of the muscles that 
					support your uterus.
					<br/><br/>
					You may also want to get involved in some regular aerobic exercise that 
					pushes your heart and lungs to perform at their peak level. Aerobic 
					exercise during pregnancy provides many benefits. It can build stamina, 
					make you more comfortable, alleviate aches and pains, and relieve stress.
					<br/><br/>
					Aerobic exercise may even make your labor shorter and less painful. An 
					American study published recently in the American Journal of Obstetrics 
					and Gynecology reported that women who continued running or aerobic 
					dancing during pregnancy enjoyed labors about 30 percent shorter than 
					women who stopped exercising. Women who maintained a regular exercise 
					program also required less labor stimulation and fewer epidurals, 
					episiotomies, and cesarean deliveries. An Italian study in the same 
					journal examined women having their second or third babies who pedaled on 
					stationary bicycles three times a week for 30 minutes beginning around the 
					fifth month of pregnancy. The bicyclists maintained higher endorphin 
					levels during labor. Accordingly, they reported less pain than a matching 
					group of sedentary women.
					<br/><br/>
					Even if regular exercise can't guarantee you a shorter or easier labor, 
					it undoubtedly can help you to cope better with whatever labor has in 
					store for you. Going into labor physically fit also means you will recover 
					more quickly afterward.
					<br/><br/>
					The aerobic exercises of swimming, walking, and bicycling are readily 
					available to most pregnant women. Or, you may choose to take an exercise 
					class or purchase an exercise videotape (see Resources). Some women even 
					continue jogging through their entire pregnancies. Be sure to get your 
					doctor's approval before embarking on an exercise program, especially if 
					you have medical problems such as high blood pressure. You should also be 
					aware of the following precautions. The American College of Obstetricians 
					and Gynecologists has established these guidelines to help prevent your 
					core body temperature from rising too high and possibly harming your baby:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Keep your heart rate under 140 beats per minute during exercise.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check your temperature by armpit or rectum at the end of your 
							usual exercise to make sure it is less than 101 degrees.
						</li>
						<li>
							Limit very strenuous exercise to 15 minutes at a time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Replenish fluids after exercising.
						</li>
						<li>
							Avoid exercising outdoors in very hot weather or if you have a 
							fever.
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Walking through Labor 
					</h3>
					Given freedom of choice, few women in any part of the world lie down 
					during labor. The supine (flat on the back) position reportedly originated 
					in the French court of Louis XIV. A voyeur who relished watching his 
					mistress giving birth, the king's quirky preferences soon dictated fashion 
					for the country. The supine position found almost universal favor in 
					United States hospitals from the 1940s on because a woman's lying flat 
					enabled her obstetrician to perform interventions such as forceps 
					delivery, anesthesia, and episiotomy more easily.
					<br/><br/>
					But lying down has no medical benefits for most mothers. In fact, it 
					carries several proven risks. When you lie on your back for long periods 
					of time, the weight of the uterus compresses the descending aorta and 
					inferior vena cava, blood vessels that supply or drain the lower part of 
					your body. This interference with your circulation reduces your blood 
					pressure, compromising blood flow to your baby and causing his heart rate 
					to drop. When you stay upright (or at least off your back), placental 
					circulation improves and fetal heart rate abnormalities may be alleviated.
					<br/><br/>
					A host of medical studies have demonstrated conclusively that upright 
					positions shorten and ease labor. One famous Latin American study 
					comparing reclining to vertical positions showed that labors for women 
					who stayed upright were 36 percent shorter for first-time mothers and 25 
					percent shorter for mothers who had previously given birth. A British 
					study comparing mothers who walked during labor to mothers who stayed in 
					bed demonstrated that walking not only shortened labor but also reduced 
					pain and the need for medication.
					<br/><br/>
					How does walking help your labor along? For one thing, your contractions 
					become stronger, more regular, and more frequent when you stand up. 
					Gravity helps your baby make his way through your pelvis. Furthermore, 
					the upright position improves both the angle of your baby's body to your 
					spine and the application of his head to your cervix. Because your uterus 
					naturally tilts forward in your abdomen during contractions, it meets the 
					least resistance when you are standing, leaning slightly forward. Finally, 
					even though contractions get stronger when you're upright, many women feel 
					more comfortable, more in charge, and better able to relax in this 
					position. A typical mother put it this way: "When I lay down, it slowed 
					my labor down in the early stage. When I was in active labor, I found 
					lying down much more painful than when I was walking."
					<br/><br/>
					To promote your labor, keep walking as long as you can. One couple took a 
					scenic stroll along the lakefront near their home before checking into the 
					hospital when the woman's contractions were three minutes apart. Another 
					mother remembers "walking and walking and walking around the apartment. 
					During a contraction I would just hold onto something for support--a chair 
					or my husband.
					<br/><br/>
					Because you'll probably need to rest while you're having contractions, 
					learn to lean on your partner in a manner that won't make him sore the 
					next day. Janet Balaskas, the author of Active Birth, suggests this as the 
					best way for your partner to carry your weight properly: As you drape 
					yourself around your partner, he should keep his shoulders down, bend his 
					knees, and lean back slightly while tightening his buttocks. It's 
					especially important for your partner not to bend forward with raised 
					shoulders, because this will give him a backache.

					<h3>
						Changing Positions during Labor
					</h3>
					Most women can't spend their entire labor walking around. Especially in a 
					long labor, you may need to alternate walking with resting. Brief periods 
					of sitting, kneeling, or side-lying can help you rest by temporarily 
					reducing the strength of your contractions. Simply changing positions 
					regularly will probably help you to be comfortable longer than any one 
					"best" position you could find. One study found that obstetrical patients 
					assumed an average of 7.5 different positions in labor.
					<br/><br/>
					Joyce Roberts, Ph.D., Professor of Maternal-Child Nursing at the 
					University of Illinois at Chicago, has spent years researching positions 
					for labor and delivery. Roberts points out, "A woman's contractions are 
					most efficient if she alternately sits and stands during labor." It's also 
					necessary, she says, to adopt positions that are comfortable and 
					appropriate for your particular labor.
					<br/><br/>
					For example, you may need to be in bed because of bleeding, fetal 
					distress, or premature rupture of membranes with your baby's head in a 
					high position. If you have received an epidural, you have to stay in bed. 
					If you are instructed to lie on your back, make sure your head is elevated 
					with pillows and that you have a pillow or rolled-up blanket under one hip 
					to tilt your uterus off your backbone. According to Roberts, alternating 
					every half hour between lying on your back and lying on your side can help 
					prevent the adverse effects reclining has on your blood pressure, your 
					baby's heart rate, and your labor's progress.
					<br/><br/>
					Side-lying makes contractions less frequent than when you are standing, 
					but they are also more efficient. Best of all, side-lying is good for your 
					blood pressure. In fact, because it enhances circulation to your uterus, 
					this position is often employed when a baby appears to be in distress.
					<br/><br/>
					As long as your labor is progressing normally, however, you may want to 
					try any or all of the following positions in preference to lying flat, 
					which tends to lengthen your labor and add to its risk and discomfort:
					<ul>
						<li>
							STAND - leaning against your partner, a high counter, or a bed.
						</li>
						<li>
							KNEEL - on all fours or with your arms and head against some 
							pillows on an upraised bed. You could also try this on the floor, 
							leaning on a cushion placed on the seat of a chair.
						</li>
						<li>
							HALF-KNEEL/HALF-SQUAT - with one knee up and one knee down, in 
							bed or on the floor. This is easier than squatting, described 
							below. If it feels good to you, rock back and forth toward your 
							raised knee during the contractions. Change legs as needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							SIT UPRIGHT - in bed or straddle a chair, leaning on a pillow 
							on the back of the chair. A review of labor positions by the 
							International Childbirth Education Association concluded that 
							labor contractions were least efficient in sitting and supine 
							positions. But sitting may still afford you a needed rest.
						</li>
						<li>
							SQUAT - on the floor or on the bed. When you squat, your pelvic 
							outlet opens to its widest diameter and your contractions will be 
							strong and effective.
						</li>
					</ul>
					Before you go into labor, you should practice squatting to build up your 
					endurance. With your feet one and a half to two feet apart and your heels 
					flat on the floor, descend gradually, without bouncing, and hold the squat 
					for 15 to 20 seconds. Work up to holding this position for a minute at a 
					time. If you have trouble keeping your feet flat, widen your stance a bit, 
					or try putting a rolled blanket under your heels, or wearing low heels, or 
					sitting on a short stack of books. Rise up slowly and repeat several times. 
					If you need help balancing, lean against your partner or grasp a chair or 
					bed. It's not a problem if your knees "crack," but don't do this exercise 
					if you feel pain in your knees or pubic joint.
					<br/><br/>
					During labor you can vary the squatting position by squatting on the 
					floor, leaning on a chair or on the labor bed. Or ask your partner to sit 
					down on the bed or chair; facing away from him, try dangling into a squat, 
					resting your elbows on his knees.
					<br/><br/>
					You could also squat in bed, supported under your arms on one side by your 
					partner and on the other by a nurse. Or try squatting on the side of the 
					bed with your arms draped around your partner's neck. Your partner could 
					even sit behind you in bed, toboggan-style, supporting you under the arms 
					as you squat. You could sit-squat on the low footstool in the labor room. 
					Put a pillow and sterile pad on it, and just sit down with your knees 
					higher than your hips. Or perch on a short pile of books, a large cushion, 
					or a beanbag chair.
					<br/><br/>
					Look at the positions illustrated in the book. Incorporate them into your 
					practice of prepared childbirth techniques, so you can find out which ones 
					are most comfortable for you and your partner.
					<br/><br/>
					One mother who moved around a lot during her labor remembers, "standing, 
					holding on to the bureau, and literally dancing through the contractions. 
					At times I would go from sitting to standing to all fours. My husband 
					danced along next to me, wiping my face with a cloth, following me when 
					I started walking, letting me hold on to him. During transition, I climbed 
					on the bed and got onto all fours, then walked around again when the 
					contraction was over."
					<br/><br/>
					You're probably wondering how you can do all this when standard hospital 
					routines--fetal monitoring and IVs, for example--appear to command your 
					complete immobility. It may not be easy.
					<br/><br/>
					You'll need to negotiate with your doctor well in advance of going into 
					labor and come to a meeting of minds about the conduct of your birth. Many 
					physicians insist on continuous electronic fetal monitoring and IVs in 
					high-risk labors. But women may be monitored by remote control or on an 
					intermittent basis, preserving their ability to move around. If an IV is 
					medically necessary, it can be attached to a mobile pole, if your doctor 
					agrees (see chapter 17).
					<br/><br/>
					If you learn that your hospital's or doctor's custom is to confine all 
					women to bed for the duration of labor, you may want to express your own 
					wishes and come to a compromise. It may be a good idea to have any 
					agreement you reach entered into your chart, especially if your doctor 
					might not be at the hospital while you are in labor.
					<br/><br/>
					You could plan simply to arrive at the hospital at a point late enough in 
					labor that you are willing to get into bed. Or you may decide to switch to 
					a birthing environment that respects your need to be comfortably active 
					during labor.
