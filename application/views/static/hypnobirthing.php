                    Hypnosis is a natural way of coping with childbirth pain.

                        What is HypnoBirthing?
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            HypnoBirthing is the use of hypnosis to achieve maximum relaxation, 
                            comfort, and relief during childbirth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The HypnoBirthing method is based on the work of Grantly Dick-Read, 
                            MD, the English obstetrician who wrote Childbirth Without Fear in 
                            1944. According to Dr. Dick-Read, use of hypnosis during labor 
                            helps laboring women break what he termed the "Fear-Tension-Pain 
                            syndrome" which makes labor more difficult. He believed the 
                            syndrome actually caused blood to flow away from nonessential 
                            organs such as the uterus to large muscle groups in the legs. He 
                            theorized that relaxation achieved through hypnosis would prevent 
                            that from happening.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Marie F. Mongan, Director of the HypnoBirthing Institute, says that 
                            with the aid of hypnosis, a woman can bring her body into a state 
                            of deep relaxation in which the body's muscles can work the way 
                            they're meant to during childbirth. She says it feels similar to 
                            daydreaming, or the feeling you get when you are lost in a book or 
                            movie. People who've used this technique report feeling relaxed, 
                            calm, aware, and in control.

                    How Does HypnoBirthing Work?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The process of HypnoBirthing is based on the power of suggestion. 
                            The laboring woman uses positive affirmations, suggestions, and 
                            visualizations to relax her body, guide her thoughts, and control 
                            her breathing. She can either do this herself (self-hypnosis) or 
                            receive assistance from a hypnotherapist. Sometimes women work with 
                            a certified hypnotherapist to learn self-hypnosis. They often play 
                            a tape of verbal affirmations that help them enter a calm state of 
                            self-hypnosis. Alternately, they might use a visualization -- such 
                            as a flower opening its petals -- to picture what's happening to 
                            them, and achieve relaxation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A hypnotherapist may or may not be present during the birth, 
                            depending on the needs of the laboring woman. For some people 
                            self-hypnosis is easy to achieve, while others respond better to 
                            the assistance of a therapist.

                    If You're Interested in This Method...
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Ask your family doctor or obstetrician for a referral to a trained 
                            practitioner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Contact your hospital or birthing center to ask if they've had 
                            HypnoBirths and if they can provide you with a list of 
                            hypnotherapists specializing in childbirth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you've found a few practitioners, ask for patient referrals 
                            and follow up.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Share your birth plan with your hypnotherapist so she understands 
                            what you envision for your birthing experience.
