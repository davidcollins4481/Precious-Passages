                    Erika and Alyssa are very knowledgeable, compassionate, and devoted 
                    midwives. Their no-nonsense, matter-of-fact way is exactly what I 
                    needed to help me through my labor. My homebirth experience changed my 
                    life and I hope to one day have the opportunity to have another baby with 
                    Erika and Alyssa watching over us. Thanks you, Ladies!

                    Erika is very educated on all aspects of birthing and prenatal care. She 
                    helped us make sense of issues that came up during our pregnancy and let 
                    us know what options there were out there for us to make the right 
                    decision for our family. Erika was a very valuable person in the delivery 
                    room as she not only helped myself cope with an intense labor but was also 
                    there for my husband. She treated us with the utmost respect and gentle 
                    care and came back to the hospital the next day to follow up. I will 
                    always treasure my birth experience and keep in mind how she contributed 
                    to making it happen. Thank you for helping  me have the birth I wanted.

                    Having Erika present to provide both emotional and physical support during 
                    labor made the labor and delivery process a lot easier.  I know that I 
                    could not have gotten through it without her.

                    Thank you for helping my husband and I bring our baby into this world 
                    through natural childbirth. We are so grateful for your knowledge and 
                    friendship.  What a wonderful service and work you provide. I couldn't 
                    have done it without you. You are worth your weight in gold!

                    After a stressful hospital birth with our first child, I couldn't have 
                    asked for a more perfect and healing home waterbirth experience. Erika is 
                    absolutely the best! Such a wonderful experience, getting to know not only 
                    Erika, but her beautiful family as well. My husband &amp; I can't stop 
                    raving about this birth experience to everyone!
