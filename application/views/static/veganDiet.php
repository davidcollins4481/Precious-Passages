                    This program is designed for you if you are 
                    expecting one baby and you have no significant additional protein/calorie 
                    requirements, based on your responses to the Brewer Pregnancy Nutrition

                <p>
                    If you plan to avoid eating foods of animal origin during pregnancy and 
                    breastfeeding, you have to be the most careful of all expectant and 
                    breastfeeding mothers. There is absolutely no room in your diet for 
                    non-nutritious foods, primarily because of the higher proportion of 
                    food fiber in vegan diets. This fiber fills you up fast! This 
                    characteristic also accounts for most of the Brewer Hotline calls from 
                    vegetarians who are getting behind on their pregnancy nutrition 
                    requirements: It's hard to consume all the food you need to make your 
                    calorie and protein goals. Taking in fewer calories than you need for 
                    your level of activity and stage of pregnancy means a reduction in the 
                    amount of protein you have available for your baby's growth and the 
                    maintenance of your own tissues. This is a major hazard of the vegan 
                    diet, but with proper dietary choices, it can be overcome. Vegetable 
                    oils and fats from nuts give a much-needed boost to your overall calorie 
                    intake. In a typical meat-eaters diet, nuts are generally regarded as 
                    luxury items. For you, they become a staple. Other features of the the 
                    Brewer Vegetarian Pregnancy Diet #2 (Vegan) that make it markedly 
                    different from both the basic Plan and the Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian Diet 
                    are the following: Beans and grains, in appropriate combinations, become 
                    your major source of protein. 1. You eat many servings of fresh fruits 
                    and vegetables to obtain your vitamins and minerals. 2. Soy products take 
                    a prominent place in your diet. Soy milk and soy cheeses replace animal 
                    milks and cheese completely. This means you must make a major effort to 
                    expand your intake of calcium-rich and vitamin A foods, both of which are 
                    poorly supplied by soybeans. 3. Dense, homemade breads, cakes, and 
                    main-dish loaves that combine proteins and thereby 4. concentrate 
                    essential amino acids in a small volume of food perform for you more or 
                    less the way meat does in a standard diet. Dietary supplements over and 
                    above those provided by the foods on the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet 
                    supplement list (Group 14) are necessary. Getting enough vitamin B12 
                    is a particular problem for you. 5. Please use cast-iron cookware in 
                    the preparation of one dish at each meal. This practice will go far 
                    toward improving your iron status. At each meal, also include a vitamin 
                    C source to increase your absorption of the iron being supplied by the 
                    cookware. 6.

                    If you get the impression that there are significant concerns about the 
                    adequacy of the vegan diet for pregnancy, you are correct. Two or three 
                    times a week the Brewer Hotline has unfortunate consultations with women 
                    who are very well-meaning about their vegetarianism, but whose diets 
                    simply are not meeting the minimum nutrient levels for successful 
                    pregnancy. However, it is also clear that if you are a dedicated vegan, 
                    merely reading advice to use animal milks and cheeses and eggs for a 
                    concentrated protein-calorie source during pregnancy isn't going to 
                    change your mind at all. Instead, it is necessary to rev up your vegan 
                    nutritional program to a level that is more likely to result in a healthy 
                    outcome for you and your baby.
                    <br/>
                    Approximately 30 years ago, The Farm, a spiritual community in 
                    Summertown, Tennessee, adopted a soy-based diet for everyone living 
                    there, including pregnant women, and their birth outcome statistics are 
                    excellent (good birth weights, an extremely low rate of maternal illness, 
                    most deliveries conducted by midwives in the parents' homes). Margaret 
                    Nofziger, the Farm nutritionist, travels the country lecturing on 
                    vegetarian nutrition for the entire family and has been instrumental in 
                    training The Farm midwives to emphasize a high-protein, high-calorie, 
                    high-sodium diet in pregnancy and lactation. Ina May Gaskin, a founder 
                    of The Farm and a leader in midwifery education and practice in the 
                    United States, has incorporated this perspective into the training of 
                    midwives internationally. Dr. Brewer was influenced by The Farm's 
                    experience to consider a soy-based diet a reasonable alternative for 
                    those who, for whatever reason, choose to exclude animal products in 
                    their diets.

                    A look at a sample Brewer Pregnancy Vegan Menu should lay to rest the 
                    idea that this type of diet is limited to beans and rice. Once you 
                    develop expertise in handling soy products in recipes that call for 
                    dairy items, there are few dishes, short of soufflés, that can't be 
                    adapted to vegan preferences. But the most interesting part of this 
                    diet for the cooking enthusiast is the wealth of new combinations that 
                    come to mind when your frame of reference changes from 
                    meat-potato-vegetables to legumes-grains-nuts-seeds! Plus, what renewed 
                    enthusiasm for fruits and vegetables, too. Even if you don't intend to 
                    remain a strict vegan or you are not any kind of vegetarian, there are 
                    many days when one of these combinations might make something special 
                    out of an ordinary dinner or lunch.

                    Each exchange provides approximately 9 grams of protein; however, soy 
                    milk as it comes from the beans may not be substituted cup for cup for 
                    animal milks. It contains only 20 percent of the calcium, 7 percent of 
                    the sodium, 75 percent of the fats, and half the calories, and it's 
                    significantly undersupplies the essential amino acids isoleucine, 
                    leucine, valine, methionine. It is possible to compensate for these 
                    deficiencies by choosing wisely from other food groups and eating those 
                    foods at the same time as you drink unfortified soy milk. However, in 
                    the interest of making room for all the rest of the food on this diet, 
                    you may be better off choosing a commercially prepared, fortified soy 
                    milk and using your other food exchanges to satisfy your other 
                    nutritional requirements. Should you choose to prepare your own soy 
                    milk, a recipe at the end of this section contains the correct forms 
                    of supplementation to make soy milk that is nutritionally equivalent 
                    to whole cow's milk.

                    If you use only unfortified soy milk or other unfortified soy products, 
                    such as tofu, tempeh, okra, miso, yuba, soy nuts, or soy flour, your 
                    diet will need calcium supplementation. Each exchange from this group 
                    provides approximately 100 milligrams of calcium. If you are expecting 
                    more than one baby, you may also use this list to increase your calcium 
                    intake from strictly non-animal sources.

                    Each individual exchange on this list provides 7 grams of protein. Each 
                    individual exchange by itself, however, has an incomplete amino acid pattern 
                    because all these choices are of plant origin. To complete the amino acid 
                    patterns, and obtain protein of the same quality as that found in eggs or 
                    milk, here are a baker's dozen vegan combinations. (Values for exchanges 
                    were computed from tables in Amino Acid Content of Foods, U.S. Department 
                    of Agriculture Home Economics Research Report, No. 4, Washington, D.C., 
                    1966.) When you combine these foods in the ratios indicated, the resulting 
                    protein is complete. To fill in the gaps in the amino acid pattern, combine 
                    soy foods with foods containing leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine. 
                    You may combine any of the soy exchanges (left) with any of the 
                    complementary foods (right) to obtain the desired result. One combination 
                    equals one exchange for Vegan Group 4, Protein Sources.

                    These foods are prime sources of the carbohydrates you need to fuel your 
                    body. On a vegan diet you may also obtain some of your protein from these 
                    sources as noted under Group 4 - Protein Combinations. However, you may not 
                    count any of your Group 4 choices under this group as well. If you do, you 
                    short-change yourself on calories, and your body then burns some of your 
                    protein exchanges for energy. This robs you and your baby of the building 
                    blocks essential for tissue growth and repair. It is the indirect route to 
                    protein deficit and a compromised pregnancy outcome. The complex 
                    carbohydrates from whole grains and starch fruits and vegetables take 
                    longer to digest and help keep your blood sugar stabilized better than the 
                    simple sugars found in candy, honey, jams, soft drinks, bakery goods, and 
                    in the sugar bowl. These complex carbohydrates are also important sources 
                    of B vitamins which assist in protein metabolism.

                    Vitamin C is important for the body's manufacture of collagen, the 
                    connective substance that holds tissues together. Without adequate C, 
                    your uterus is less strong and may not perform well in labor. Vitamin C 
                    also plays a crucial role in the body's defense system against infection. 
                    As a vegetarian you need more C than other pregnant women because the high 
                    fiber content of your diet tends to impair iron absorption. Vitamin C 
                    assists in iron absorption. Try to eat the Vitamin C exchanges along with 
                    your soy exchanges since the soy products are your major sources of iron.

                    Each exchange provides 8 grams of fats. These are needed in your diet to 
                    help your body absorb the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K Fats and 
                    oils also contribute to fine-textured skin that functions well. Fats and 
                    oils are also a concentrated source of calories, which you need in greatly 
                    increased amounts during pregnancy and which are easy to miss in the vegan 
                    diet since plant foods are low in calories for their volume. The six extra 
                    Vegan Group 8 exchanges in the Brewer vegan pregnancy diet make up for the 
                    60 grams of fats provided by milk, eggs and meat in the Brewer basic 
                    pregnancy diet that are not completely replaced by your fortified soy 
                    milk exchanges. Margarine appears on this list and nowhere else in this 
                    book because you are likely to want something to spread on bread or muffins 
                    or use in vegetable dishes and for baking. Select the softest margarine you 
                    can find (probably packaged in tubs rather than in sticks). It's the least 
                    hydrogenated. Of all the margarines, Becel® is the most recognizable by 
                    your body as food.

                    Each exchange is approximately 7,000 units. Vitamin A is important in 
                    preventing infection. During pregnancy, when the pressure of the growing 
                    uterus on the bladder is constant, extra vitamin A helps protect you 
                    against bladder and kidney infections. During breastfeeding, it helps 
                    keep you free from breast infections. Because the four glasses of milk 
                    and two eggs on the Brewer Basic Plan provide 2,600 units of vitamin A 
                    and your soy milk exchanges total only 360 units, you need an extra 1/2 
                    Vitamin A exchange to make up the difference. Your other extra Vitamin A 
                    exchange, compared with the amounts in the Brewer Basic Plan, substitutes 
                    for the Vitamin A in the liver you are not eating.

                    Salt or season your food to taste. Cutting back on salt can cause a 
                    fall in the amount of blood circulating through your placenta, thus 
                    reducing the supply of nutrients passing to your baby. Too little salt 
                    in the diet leads to leg cramps as well, since all the muscles of your 
                    body require sodium for efficient functioning. To acclimate your taste 
                    buds gradually to salt, if you have been using little or no salt out 
                    of health concerns, add a little at a time to your food, or use more 
                    of kelp powder or soy sauce for seasoning. It is essential that you 
                    have enough sodium to support the expansion of your blood volume 
                    throughout your pregnancy.

                    Drink to quench thirst, but do not force fluids. Fruits, vegetables, 
                    and juices all contain a goodly proportion of water plus additional 
                    nutrients. Forcing water may fill you up without giving you much 
                    nutrition - a hazard in late pregnancy, when you have to make every 
                    bite count and you have less and less space in which to put the food. 
                    Diet beverages, coffee, teas, and imitation fruit drinks should be 
                    avoided for the same reason. If you are thirsty drink water or 
                    something nutritious (real juice or a milk beverage) or an occasional 
                    tea.  Note: If your drinking water is from a well, you may wish to have 
                    it tested by your health department before drinking it during pregnancy 
                    to make sure it does not contain contaminants such as MTBE, PCBs, 
                    and/or organisms such as giardia that can cause chronic intestinal 
                    upsets. Reports from the EPA published in 1999 and 2000 on water 
                    quality in the United States indicate that more than a third of all 
                    wells in the U.S. (some of them supplies for municipal water systems) 
                    contain higher than permissible amounts of these contaminants. Based on 
                    the results of your testing, you may wish to filter and/ or treat your 
                    drinking water.
