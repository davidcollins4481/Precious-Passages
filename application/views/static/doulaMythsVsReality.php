                    Doula Myths vs Realities
                </h1>
                
                <p>
                    1. Myth: A doula shows up for the labor and birth then leaves.<br/>
                    Truth: Doulas strive to provide "continuity of care".  This means 
                    the doula forms a relationship with the mother and her partner 
                    during pregnancy, cares for the couple during labor and birth, 
                    then provides follow up care to ensure that the mother, father 
                    and baby have adjusted to their new roles and their new environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Myth : A doula won't allow a laboring woman to take any pain 
                    relief drugs.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula is there to help support a laboring woman and help 
                    ensure a safe and satisfying childbirth as the couple defines it.  
                    A doula will not make medical decisions for the laboring couple.  
                    A doula will not judge a couple's decision to have pain relief.  
                    Instead, a doula will help the couple explore and understand both 
                    the benefits and drawbacks of using pain relieving drugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Myth: If you've met one doula, you've met them all.<br/>
                    Truth: While every certified doula abides my the certifying 
                    body's 'scope of practice', each doula is unique.  Interview 
                    several doulas to find someone whose philosophy, personality 
                    and areas of specialty most closely meet your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Myth: A doula will interfere with medical advice.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula will not interfere with medical advice. 
                    She facilitates communication between all involved and 
                    encourages the couple to ask relevant questions so they 
                    can make informed choices. Doulas do not make decisions 
                    for their clients and doulas DO NOT offer medical advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Myth: A doula will "take over" the role of the partner.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula is there to enhance the relationships between 
                    the hospital staff, the laboring couple and others present. 
                    Often times the partner will become more involved with a doula 
                    present.  As Penny Simkin, P.T. states "While the doula probably 
                    knows more than the partner about birth, hospitals and maternity 
                    care, the partner knows more about the woman's personality, likes 
                    and dislikes, and needs. Moreover, he or she loves the woman more 
                    than anyone else there."  A good doula will reinforce the fact 
                    that this is your birth, not hers.  She will strengthen the pair 
                    bond by instilling confidence in the partner and facilitating 
                    open communication between the couple and others present.

                    6. Myth: A doula will take away "the best part of a nurse's job."<br/>
                    Truth: A laboring woman can never have too much support. Nurses 
                    and doulas realize this.  While a doula is not a nurse, she is 
                    still a birth professional who is skilled in the art of labor 
                    support.  A doula strives to work as a team with the nursing 
                    staff and welcomes any suggestions and physical support that 
                    the nurse may provide.  Nurses are often responsible for several 
                    laboring women at the same time and their shifts may end before 
                    you deliver.  The doula is there just for you.  Her obligation, 
                    unlike a nurse, is completely and sovereignly to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Myth: A doula has a negative opinion about a hospital setting.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula has the utmost respect for the lifesaving technology 
                    available for unexpected circumstances in a hospital.  While doulas 
                    have a strong belief in a woman's ability to birth her baby and 
                    always strive to ensure that the birthing process remains normal, 
                    doulas appreciate the judicious use of life saving technology when 
                    the situation becomes abnormal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    8. Myth: Doulas are not necessary because the nurse (partner, 
                    family member, friend, fill in the blank) is there.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula does not perform clinical skills, is not 
                    encumbered by hospital procedures, and is not overwhelmed 
                    by caring for several women at the same time. She is the only 
                    member of the maternity care team who is focused completely on 
                    the mother's well being and will remain with the woman constantly 
                    from the beginning of labor to the end. A doula is not emotionally 
                    involved with the laboring woman, as are other family members and 
                    close friends. The doula knows what to expect and remains calm and 
                    objective when she sees the laboring woman in pain.  Often, a doula 
                    has seen significantly more unmedicated births than the hospital 
                    staff.

                <p>
                    9. Myth: A doula will leave if the mother gets an epidural.<br/>
                    Truth: There seems to be an urban legend of sorts about the doula 
                    who left as soon as the mom got an epidural. This is not usual. 
                    A doula is there to support the laboring woman with any decisions 
                    she makes. She still needs continuous support even with an epidural. 
                    The doula can give dad/partner a break to go get something to eat 
                    or to take a nap if it's been a particularly long labor. She can 
                    take pictures, get ice-chips, do hand massage or just sit quietly 
                    while the woman rests.

                <p>
                    10. Myth: Doulas secretly want to catch the baby.<br/>
                    Truth: A doula does not have the clinical skills or the 
                    knowledge to want to receive the baby on her own. Trying 
                    to deliver the baby on her own would be a dangerous decision 
                    that would not ensure the safe passage of mother and baby 
                    through the birth process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11. Myth: Doulas only attend home births.<br/>
                    Truth: Doulas attend births at home, at the hospital and at 
                    birth centers. She will remain at home with the laboring woman 
                    until it is time to go to the hospital/birth center (where 
                    applicable).  The fact is that the vast majority of women 
                    living in the United States birth in a hospital setting and 
                    therefore most of the births a doula attends are in the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    12. Myth: All doulas are "patchouli-wearing, tree-hugging, 
                    earthy vegetarians"<br/>
                    Truth: The majority of doulas are professional, well-educated 
                    women. The key is to find a doula who suits your individual needs 
                    and personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    13. Myth: A doula has her own 'birth plan' and strives to make 
                    the couple follow it.<br/>
                    Truth: A good doula will help you formulate your own birth plan 
                    and then bend over backwards to follow it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    14. Myth: A doula leaves as soon as the baby is born and that's the 
                    end of the relationship.<br/>
                    Truth: Part of a birth doula's responsibility is to facilitate 
                    uninterrupted bonding time between baby and parents and to ensure 
                    that if a mother intends to breastfeed that she is able to do so.  
                    Additionally, most doulas offer at least one postpartum visit and 
                    most have a comprehensive list of community resources to help 
                    you deal with any postpartum problems.
