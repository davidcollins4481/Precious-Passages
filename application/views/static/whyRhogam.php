						What is Rh- Blood? 
					</h3>
					Human blood either has the "Rh factor" or it does not. If you have the 
					Rh factor in your blood you're Rh+ and you have nothing to worry about. 
					But if you do not have the Rh factor in your blood then you are Rh- and 
					it could cause complications. Your Rh- blood recognizes the Rh factor 
					as an intruder to your bloodstream and begins to attack it (form 
					antibodies against it). If your baby is Rh+ and your blood mixes with 
					your baby's, then your body could view your baby as a foreign invader 
					and begin attacking the Rh factor in his or her blood.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						The Risk is Low
					</h3>
					At first you may be scared. If you have Rh- blood and your baby is Rh+, 
					your body could hurt your baby! But in reality, the chances of that
					happening are very slim. Your blood and your baby's blood do not mix. 
					They flow side by side, but separated by a thin membrane. Since the 
					blood doesn't mix, no antibodies are manufactured by your body. Certain 
					things can cause a mother and baby's blood to mix. Sometimes a mix 
					occurs during miscarriage, amniocentesis, chorionic villi sampling 
					(CVS), or major trauma (such as a direct fall on the belly or a car 
					wreck). Mixing can also occur during birth. It's rare during a natural 
					birth where the placenta is allowed to separate on its own. However, 
					interventions increase the risk that a mother and baby's blood will 
					mix.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						The Shot 
					</h3>
					The anti-D injection (called Rhogam for simplicity's sake) works much 
					like an immunization. It puts a small amount of antibody into the 
					mother's body, effectively "fooling" her body into thinking that the 
					problem has been taken care of. The shot is very effective. However, 
					Rhogam must be given within 72 hours of the trauma. After that the body 
					will have begun making its own antibodies and the Rhogam won't work.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Drawbacks 
					</h3>
					The 72 hour limit means that any shot given in the prenatal period is
					probably arbitrary. Doctors must admit that the 28 week dose (and 36 
					week with some doctors) is simply given at a random date chosen with 
					the hope that it may protect some babies. An injection given after a 
					known trauma is much more effective and makes much more sense. Rhogam 
					is made from human blood plasma (as are all anti-D preparations.) It's 
					highly filtered, but it is still a human blood product. There is still 
					risk of disease from donor blood. There are also other side effects 
					such as swelling and inflammation. Hives and anaphylactic effects are 
					among more severe side effects. Some studies have indicated that having 
					the injection may affect the immune response of both mother and baby to 
					other foreign substances entering the blood stream. Pregnant women who 
					are Rh- and whose partners are Rh+ (two Rh- parents must produce an Rh- 
					baby) must weigh carefully the risks and the benefits of each Rhogam 
					injection. If a baby's blood is attacked by Rh antibodies, the newborn 
					will have Rh disease. This is most likely to happen with the baby 
					coming after a mother is sensitized, not during the pregnancy that 
					the sensitization occurs in. According to the March of Dimes almost 
					all babies born with Rh disease will be cured, but it is still a very 
					serious condition requiring a lot of intensive care. If a mother 
					chooses to have the injection, she must face any possible side effects 
					on her own body. There may also be side effects for her baby. In 
					addition, she must be sure that the prenatal dose is given within 72 
					hours of any trauma.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Foregoing Rhogam 
					</h3>
					A woman is free to reject or accept any combination of Rhogam (for 
					instance, she can refuse it prenatally and still have it after birth). 
					If a woman chooses not to have Rhogam, there are things she can do to 
					make it more likely that her blood and her baby's do not mix. A 
					natural, intervention free birth is the best birth for an Rh- mother 
					wishing to avoid Rhogam. A completely natural birth gives the lowest 
					risk of maternal and fetal blood mixing. Wait for the cord to stop 
					pulsing before it is cut. This allows most of the blood to flow into 
					the baby's body. The third stage of labor is possibly the most vital 
					part of labor to keep natural. Allow the placenta to separate 
					naturally and be born gently. Strong contractions will help the 
					placenta to shear cleanly off the surface of the uterus and continued 
					contractions will seal off the blood vessels. A mother can squat and 
					birth the placenta gently. If the placenta has fully separated, very 
					gentle cord traction may bring it out. If the birth is natural and the 
					placenta is born gently, the chances of mother and baby's blood mixing 
					are very low, and so the risk of maternal sensitization is also quite 
					low. Blood can be drawn from the umbilical cord to determine the 
					baby's blood type.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Making the Choice 
					</h3>
					Choosing to have or not to have prenatal Rhogam is not easy. Choosing 
					a human blood product always requires careful weighing of the pros and 
					cons. Postpartum, Rhogam decisions can be made after the baby's blood 
					type is discovered. Prenatally, Rhogam is almost always prescribed 
					routinely and arbitrarily. With sound prenatal nutrition and a gentle 
					natural birth, the risks of mother and baby's blood mixing are 
					minimal. Seek to have a healthy pregnancy and be fully informed before 
					consenting to having any foreign substance injected into your body.
