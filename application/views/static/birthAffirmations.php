                <p>
                    Birth is a completely normal event.<br/>
					I love my body and gain confidence in its ability to birth every 
					day.<br/>
					I deserve a positive birth experience.<br/>
					My body instinctively knows how to labor and birth.<br/>
					My body labors effectively and releases my baby in its own time.<br/>
					I feel confident that I will labor and give birth the way I want 
					to.<br/>
					Our baby feels my calm confidence.<br/>
					With each contraction our baby is closer to being born.<br/>
					I have enough energy to birth our baby.<br/>
					I trust my caregivers, my partner, my body and my baby.<br/>
					I feel safe and want to give birth here [in this location].<br/>
					I will breathe slowly and deeply to relax my muscles and bring 
					oxygen to our baby.<br/>
					I feel the strong muscular waves of labor and know things are 
					progressing normally.<br/>
					I am in sync with my body and my intuition.<br/>
					The experience of labor and birth is a great gift.<br/>
