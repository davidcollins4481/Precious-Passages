                    In the past, most Americans were born at home with lay midwives 
                    attending. The mortality rate for both mothers and babies was higher 
                    in 1900, at 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (Korte and Scaer 97), 
                    than it is now. Babies also died at a significantly higher rate at that 
                    time, which decreased to 28.9 births per thousand by 1960 (Korte and 
                    Scaer 98). Obstetricians tend to emphasize that many women used to die 
                    in childbirth, implying that we should be grateful for current obstetric 
                    practice. However, even in 1900, the percent of women who died giving 
                    birth was only 7/10ths of one percent! One has to wonder how this 
                    percentage compares with our country’s current cesarean section rate 
                    of 22%. Are the surgeries performed on these mothers actually saving 
                    them from imminent death? Maternal and infant mortality are lower now 
                    than they were 40 years ago. But the assumption that hospital birth is 
                    safer for mother and baby has never been supported (Jones 6). Prenatal 
                    care, better nutrition, antibiotics and blood transfusion have played 
                    more of a part in the relative safety of birth now.

                    Sheila Kitzinger, British childbirth expert, states that planned 
                    home birth with an experienced lay midwife has a perinatal death 
                    rate of 3-4 babies per 1,000 births (51). Hospital births, by 
                    contrast, carry a perinatal mortality rate of 9-10/1,000. [Perinatal 
                    death rates include fetal deaths on and after 28 weeks gestation, 
                    whereas neonatal mortality rates only include deaths occurring in 
                    the first 28 days after birth (Jones 96,98)].

                            A study in Australia found a perinatal mortality rate of 
                            5.9/1,000 out of 3400 planned home births (Kitzinger 41).

                            Joseph C. Pearce states in his landmark book Evolution’s End 
                            that homebirthed babies have a six to one better chance of 
                            survival than a hospital-birthed child (117).

                            A study in the Netherlands done in 1986 on women who were 
                            having their first babies showed these results: out of 41,861 
                            women who delivered in the hospital, the perinatal mortality 
                            rate was 20.2/1,000. Of 15,031 women who delivered at home 
                            with a trained midwife, the rate was 1.5/1,000 (Kitzinger 44). 
                            I know, I thought it must be a typo too.

                            Marsden Wagner, formerly of the World Health Organization, 
                            states that every country in the European Region that has 
                            infant mortality rates better than the US uses midwives as 
                            the principal and only attendant for at least 70% of the 
                            births (Jones 2). He also states that the countries with 
                            the lowest perinatal mortality rates in the world have 
                            cesarean section rates below 10% (Jones 13). How does this 
                            compare with the US rate? Miserably.

                    Cesarean section and hospital birth is not doing for women and their 
                    newborns what doctors and hospitals claim it is! Ask for statistics 
                    and studies when your doctor claims hospital birth is safer than 
                    planned (not accidental, unattended) home birth. I would be interested 
                    to see them. If your doctor says, "That’s common knowledge," you would 
                    be wise to seek another health care provider. I have only heard of one 
                    study done that claimed hospital birth was safer. It included deaths 
                    caused by unplanned, unattended births which occurred at home, and was 
                    backed by (guess who?) ACOG (The American College of Obstetricians &amp; 
                    Gynecologists).

                        <li>
                            Dr. Lewis Mehl did a study comparing home and hospital birth 
                            with mothers from California and Wisconsin with matched 
                            populations of 2,092 mothers for each group. Midwives and 
                            family doctors attended the homebirths; OBGYNs and family 
                            doctors attended hospital births. Within the hospital group, 
                            the fetal distress rate was 6 times higher. Maternal 
                            hemorrhage was 3 times higher. Limp, unresponsive newborns 
                            arrived 3 times more often. Neonatal infections were 4 times 
                            as common. There were 30 permanent birth injuries caused by 
                            doctors (Jones 99).

                            Dr. Mehl did another study comparing 1,046 home births with 
                            1,046 hospital births. The groups were matched for age, risk 
                            factors, etc. There was no difference in infant mortality. 
                            None! However the hospital births caused more fetal distress, 
                            lacerations to the mother, neonatal infections and so on. 
                            There was a higher rate of forceps and C-section delivery and 
                            nine times as many episiotomies (Jones 110).

                            Robert C. Goodlin reported in the Lancet on 1,000 births, 
                            half occurring in a hospital, half in a birth center. There 
                            were no IVs, monitors or anesthesia used in the birth center, 
                            but the babies were born in better condition. Besides that, 
                            three times as many cesareans were performed in the hospital 
                            (Korte and Scaer 37-38).

                            In 1982, Anita Bennett and Ruth Lubic evaluated 2000 births 
                            that had happened in 11 freestanding birth centers. The 
                            neonatal death rate was 4.6/1,000. The authors were denied 
                            information on low-risk women delivering in hospitals (Korte 
                            and Scaer 45). One wonders why....

                            I found these comments very interesting. A British research 
                            statistician, Marjorie Tew, did long term studies of the 
                            safety of birth in various settings during the 1980s. She 
                            found that among a sample of 16,200 births, the perinatal 
                            mortality rate was lower for out-of-hospital births, even 
                            for very high risk mothers! At a relatively high risk level, 
                            perinatal mortality was three times higher in hospital (Korte 
                            and Scaer 49). Tew then expanded her research by using 
                            information from the Netherlands, a nation where both 
                            obstetricians and midwives practice. The perinatal mortality 
                            rate was ten times higher in the hospital births there, even 
                            though the risk status of the mothers at the time of delivery 
                            was not much higher than that of mothers who chose midwives 
                            (Korte and Scaer 50).

                        <li>
                            In the Netherlands, which has a significantly lower infant 
                            mortality rate than ours, the C-section rate is 7% (Jones 20). 
                            The episiotomy rate is 6%, whereas ours is 90% (Jones 19). 
                            Midwives attend most of the births in the Netherlands. 
                            (Midwives tend to allow time for the woman's tissues to 
                            stretch and to use perineal massage, warm compresses, and good 
                            head flexion to avoid both episiotomies and tearing; hence 
                            the lower Netherlands rate.)

                            care, even when they are high risk and may also require 
                            physician care, ranked second (Jones 95).

                            Between 1978 and 1985, licensed midwives in Arizona had a 
                            perinatal mortality rate of 2.2/1,000 and a neonatal mortality 
                            rate of 1.1/1,000 (Jones 96).

                            This stat is priceless. Read on: In Madera County Hospital in 
                            California, where there is a transient, high risk population, 
                            midwives did the best job. In 1959, when doctors did the 
                            deliveries the neonatal mortality rate was 23.9/1,000. During 
                            1960-1963, midwives had a rate of 10.3/1,000. When OBGYNs took 
                            over again in 1964, the rate skyrocketed to 32.1/1,000 (Jones 
                            98).

                    Carl Jones says, and I concur, "No one can tell a mother she is 
                    perfectly safe giving birth at home. Whether she is safer at home 
                    than in a hospital, however, is another question" (113). There is 
                    always going to be some risk when giving birth, as in all of life, 
                    and women should be carefully screened for any health problems that 
                    could be dangerous during labor and delivery. For certain women in 
                    rare instances, obstetric care is essential. However, for most women, 
                    better, healthier results are seen when mothers chose birth centers or 
                    home births. As far as the risk of home birth goes, Our Bodies, 
                    Ourselves states, "The times when hospital care unexpectedly becomes 
                    instantaneously necessary are rare" (341). In A Good Birth, A Safe 
                    Birth, Diana Korte and Roberta Scaer quote Tew, the research 
                    statistician, who says, "The danger of home as a place of birth does 
                    not lie in its threat to the healthy survival of mothers and babies, 
                    but in its threat to the healthy survival of obstetricians and 
                    obstetric practice" (50).

                    Another factor that is important in making the choice about where to 
                    give birth may surprise you. It makes common sense, but has also been 
                    documented by several studies. Women who give birth in a hospital are 
                    much more likely to experience postpartum depression or even post 
                    traumatic stress disorder. Kitzinger states that the more 
                    interventions a woman experiences, the more likely she is to be 
                    depressed, with C-sections obviously carrying the greatest risk of 
                    depression (193). She quotes 5 or 6 studies documenting the effects 
                    of this "institutional violence."

                <p>
                    Aidan McFarlane, a British physician, notes that while 68% of hospital 
                    mothers experience postpartum depression , only 16% of home birth 
                    mothers do (Jones 24). On the Farm, a self-contained, alternative 
                    lifestyle community in Tennessee, the rate of postpartum depression 
                    was .03 percent (Korte and Scaer 183). Almost all mothers on the Farm 
                    had both a homebirth and a supportive, loving community of women to 
                    assist them postpartum. Depression, in itself, would be a major reason 
                    for mothers to consider giving birth in their own homes, if that is 
                    where they are most comfortable, especially if they had previously                     
                    experienced postpartum depression and thus were at high risk for a 
                    repeat episode.

                    Aspects of hospital birth that may strongly contribute to the 
                    incidence of postpartum depression in our country are the way the 
                    moment of birth is handled and the routine separation of baby and 
                    mother. In a study which appeared in the New England Journal of 
                    Medicine in 1972, Marshall Klaus, the "bonding" expert, found that 
                    holding the baby close released "dormant intelligences" in the mother 
                    and caused "precise shifts of brain functioning and permanent behavior 
                    changes" (Pearce 115). In other words, bonding is not just an emotional 
                    thing that only mothers think happens. It is a biochemical process 
                    that forever changes the mother, so that she knows more instinctively 
                    how to relate to her baby. In the hospital, baby cannot see mom with 
                    all the bright lights and is often inspected and observed for several 
                    hours before mother can hold it for any length of time. This is not to 
                    say love can’t make up for this loss, but motherhood might come easier 
                    if we had those natural body changes to help us. Then babies are still 
                    routinely kept in the nursery, if not most of the time, at least part 
                    of the time. The routine separation of mom and infant makes baby 
                    frightened and mom depressed (Pearce 124). This may be why postpartum 
                    depression and difficult adjustments are so common in the US and rare 
                    elsewhere. Japan moved from midwifery to obstetrical handling of 
                    births approximately 25 years ago. When older Japanese recently asked 
                    Joseph Pearce why their mothers no longer "know what to do with their 
                    children," (129) one has to wonder how much the new hospital setting 
                    has to do with it.

                    Most homebirth studies also show a significantly lower rate of 
                    C-section than hospitals have. Most stats I have seen show a rate 
                    between 1-5%, with the above quoted lower mortality rates as well. 
                    Cesarean sections themselves carry a far greater risk of additional 
                    illness or death than most people realize. I think because they have 
                    become so routine in our society, everyone feels "It’s no big deal." 
                    However, C-sections carry a 2 to 4 times greater risk of death than do 
                    vaginal deliveries (Boston Women’s Health Book Collective 341).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several studies on the risk of death from the surgery alone (i.e. 
                    factoring out the conditions the surgery was done for) have shown 
                    varying, yet consistently depressing, results. Errard and Gold found 
                    with eleven years of statistics that the risk of death from cesarean 
                    section was 26 times greater than from vaginal birth (Cohen and Estner 
                    26). Cohen and Estner also cite a study done in Georgia showing a 
                    maternal death rate of 59.3 per 100,000 women who had cesarean section 
                    versus 9.7/100.000 for women who delivered vaginally (26). A 
                    California study showed a maternal death rate 2-3 times greater from 
                    C-section. Korte and Scaer state that obstetricians admit a maternal 
                    death rate four to six times higher with cesareans (162), and add that 
                    many believe the rate is higher, giving 1 in 1,000 as the true odds of 
                    death for a c-section mother (163). You should also be aware that 
                    death is not the only complication caused by cesareans; mothers 
                    commonly experience infection after a section. Infertility problems, 
                    organ damage, and paralysis from anesthesia complications are rare but 
                    possible risks. The pain at the incision site is no picnic either.

                    Another thing to think about is how a surgery like this will affect 
                    you, your child, and your society in the long run. When mothers "fail" 
                    to give birth naturally in hospitals, as they so often do these days, 
                    their self image is harmed despite well meaning friends telling them 
                    it doesn’t matter how baby came out. Especially if mothers are not 
                    certain their sections were absolutely necessary, there is often a 
                    hidden anger that can’t be overtly expressed in our culture. Mothers 
                    may take this unacceptable anger out on the only people they can--their 
                    children. "In 1979, the government of California funded the first 
                    scientific study ever made of the root causes of crime and violence. 
                    Their first report three years later stated that the first and foremost 
                    cause of the epidemic increase of violence in America was the violence 
                    done to infants and mothers at birth" (Pearce 126). The "little things" 
                    really do matter, just as a small pebble thrown in a pond makes ripples 
                    that travel a long, long way.

                    If you are a woman with no health problems or contraindications to 
                    safe labor and delivery, consider very carefully your place of birth. 
                    Your chance of having major surgery is one in four if you choose a 
                    hospital, regardless of your current health status. Those are very 
                    good odds. If you had the opportunity to buy a million dollar lottery 
                    ticket with odds that good, you would, wouldn’t you? Don’t assume that 
                    it won’t happen to you. Since the risks to you and your baby are lower 
                    at home, and your risks of having surgery are greater if you go to a 
                    hospital, please consider homebirth as an option.

                    Wherever you decide to give birth is up to you; just remember that 
                    you can make the decisions that need to be made when you have true 
                    information. It is your body, your baby, your money, and your life on 
                    the line, not the doctor’s or anyone else’s. You have the right to 
                    accurate information and the right to decide what is best for your 
                    baby. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Also, when you ask for 
                    information, beware of health care providers who say they judge each 
                    case individually, so they can’t really give you their statistics. It 
                    probably means either they don’t know or they don’t want you to know. 
                    You will have to live with the consequences of decisions made during 
                    your labor, for better or worse. For more information or support, call
