                    A woman in Iowa was recently referred to a university hospital during 
                    her labor because of possible complications. There, it was decided that 
                    a cesarean section should be done. After the surgery was completed and 
                    the woman was resting post-operatively in her hospital room, she went 
                    into shock and died. An autopsy showed that during the cesarean section 
                    the surgeon had accidentally nicked the woman's aorta, the biggest 
                    artery in the body, leading to internal hemorrhage, shock and death.
                </p>
                <p>
					Cesarean section can save the life of the mother or her baby. Cesarean 
					section can also kill a mother or her baby. How can this be? Because 
					every single procedure or technology used during pregnancy and birth 
					carries risks, both for mother and baby. The decision to use technology 
					is a judgment call - it may make things either better or worse.
                </p>
                <p>
					We are living in the age of technology. Ever since we succeeded in 
					going to the moon, we have believed that technology can do everything 
					to solve all of our problems. So it should come as no surprise that 
					doctors and hospitals are using more and more technology on pregnant 
					and birthing women. Has it solved all the problems that can arise 
					during birth? Hardly. Let's look at the recent track record.
                </p>
                <p>
					Has the recent increasing use of technology during pregnancy and birth 
					resulted in fewer damaged or dead babies? In the United States there 
					has been no decrease in the past 30 years in the number of babies with 
					cerebral palsy. The biggest killer of newborn babies is a birth weight 
					that is too low, but the number of too-small babies born has not 
					decreased the past 20 years. The number of babies who die while still 
					in the womb has not decreased in more than a decade. While the past 10 
					years has seen a slight drop in the number of babies who die during 
					their first week after birth, the scientific data suggest an increase 
					in the number of babies who survive the first week but have permanent 
					brain damage.
                </p>
                <p>
					Is the increasing use of technology saving the lives of more pregnant 
					and birthing women? In the United States the scientific data show no 
					decrease during the past 10 years in the number of women who die 
					around the time of birth (maternal mortality). In fact, recent data 
					suggest a frightening increase in the number of women dying during 
					pregnancy and birth in the United States. So it may be that the 
					increase in the use of birth technologies is not only not saving more 
					women's lives but it is also killing more women. This possibility has 
					a reasonable scientific explanation: cesarean section and epidural 
					anesthesia have both been used more and more in this country and we 
					know that both cesarean section and epidural block can result in death.
                </p>
                <p>
					We should not be surprised with the recent poor track record of high - 
					tech birth. For many decades in the middle of the 20th century the 
					number of babies dying around the time of birth was decreasing. This 
					was due not to medical advances but mainly to such social advances as 
					less severe poverty, better nutrition and better housing. Most 
					important, the decrease in mortality was due to family planning, 
					resulting in fewer women with many pregnancies and births. Medical 
					care also was responsible for some of the decreasing mortality of 
					babies, not because of high-tech interventions but because of basic 
					medical advances, such as the discovery of antibiotics and the ability 
					to give safe blood transfusions. There has never been any scientific 
					evidence that high-tech interventions such as the routine use of 
					electronic fetal monitoring during labor decrease the mortality rate 
					of babies.
                </p>
                <p>
					What this means is that putting yourself in the hands of a high-tech 
					doctor and a high-tech hospital does not guarantee you the safest 
					birth. You must yourself take responsibility for your own birth, 
					including the decision to have technology used on you and your baby. 
					Remember, technology is not good or bad. How technology is used can 
					be good or bad. Airplanes can be used to carry you to visit your 
					family or can be used to drop bombs on women and children. How 
					technology is used on you during pregnancy and birth is of great 
					importance because it can help you and your baby or harm you and your 
					baby.
                </p>

					How to Get the Right Technology
                </h2>
                <h4>
					Choosing Your Maternity Care Provider
                </h4>
                <p>
					How do you go about being pregnant and giving birth in circumstances 
					where the use of technology is appropriate and right for you, your 
					baby and your family? The first step is to get the right health care 
					professional to assist you during the pregnancy and birth. A key 
					decision is to decide if your primary maternity care provider is to 
					be a midwife, a family physician or an obstetrician.
                </p>
                <p>
					The United States and Canada are the only countries in the world where 
					highly trained surgeons called obstetricians attend the majority of 
					normal births. The American obstetrician is to be pitied. He or she 
					is trying to be all things to all women - primary maternity care 
					provider for normal, healthy pregnant and birthing women, specialist 
					in complications of pregnancy and birth, specialist in women's 
					diseases and highly skilled surgeon. No other doctor anywhere in the 
					realm of health care tries to maintain competency at all these levels 
					and in so many areas because it is totally unreasonable to expect 
					this from one human being. Can an obstetrician do a six-hour "pelvic 
					clean out" gynecological surgical procedure on a woman with extensive 
					cancer, then rush to his or her office and do the best job of quietly 
					and patiently counseling a pregnant woman about her sex life? Not 
					likely.
                </p>
                <p>
					While American obstetricians have worked hard to convince the public 
					they are the safest people to assist at all births, the scientific 
					evidence does not support them. For example, a large scientific study 
					published in 1998 looked at all births in the United States in one 
					year - more than four million births. Because doctors really do need to 
					manage the few births that develop serious complications, the study  
					eliminated complicated births and looked only at low - risk births. 
					Compared with physician-attended low - risk births, midwife - attended  
					low risk births have 33 percent (one-third) fewer deaths among  
					newborn infants. Furthermore, midwife - attended births have 31 percent  
					(nearly one-third) fewer babies born too small, which means fewer  
					retarded and brain-damaged infants. 
                </p>
                <p>
					There is not a single report in the scientific literature that shows 
					obstetricians to be safer than midwives for low - risk or normal 
					pregnancy and birth. So if you are among the more than 75 percent of 
					all women with a normal pregnancy, the safest birth attendant for you  
					is not a doctor but a midwife.
                </p>
                <p>
					If you are considering a hospital birth with an obstetrician as your 
					primary birth attendant, ask him or her how much time he or she will 
					spend with you during your labor. One of the reasons a midwife is 
					generally a better choice to attend your hospital birth than an 
					obstetrician is because the midwife is there in the hospital with you 
					during your labor while the obstetrician is not. It is an incredible 
					irony that the obstetrician insists that the woman who is his or her 
					client give birth only in the hospital, while the obstetrician who 
					should attend her birth is not in the hospital. If your obstetrician 
					is not with you in the hospital during labor, then where is your 
					obstetrician?
                </p>
                <p>
					For 50 years now the United States has had a system of maternity care 
					in which the woman goes into labor, goes to the hospital, is admitted 
					by a labor and delivery nurse (L &amp; D nurse) who examines the woman 
					and calls the obstetrician, who is either at home or in his or her 
					office (usually seeing normal, healthy pregnant women). The 
					obstetrician gives orders over the telephone to the nurse, who then 
					assists the woman during her labor. The obstetrician may or may not 
					come by the hospital sometime during the labor to briefly check the 
					woman. But it is the job of the L &amp; D nurse to monitor the labor and 
					call the obstetrician when the birth is imminent so that the doctor 
					can rush in, catch the baby at the last minute and get all the credit 
					(and money) for "delivering" the baby. If the nurse calls the 
					obstetrician too soon and the doctor has to hang around the hospital 
					waiting for the birth, the doctor is angry with the nurse for wasting 
					his time. But if the nurse calls the obstetrician too late and the 
					baby is born before the doctor gets there, the doctor is furious with 
					the nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
					Why is it important to insist that your obstetrician be with you 
					during your labor as well as at the birth? In a study of obstetrical 
					malpractice cases involving permanent brain damage of the baby, the 
					absence of the obstetrician from the hospital during the labor played 
					a central role in causing the tragedy in approximately two - thirds of 
					the cases. This research showed that telephone conversations during a 
					hospital birth between nurses at the hospital and the doctor who was 
					not in the hospital gave rise to misunderstanding or miscommunication 
					that caused adverse effects for the mother or baby. If you choose an 
					obstetrician as your primary birth attendant and he/she cannot 
					guarantee that he/she or another obstetrician will be physically 
					present (not just on call) during your labor as well as the birth, 
					you are wasting your money and putting your baby in danger, and you 
					need to get another birth attendant.
                </p>
                <p>
					If you doubt this description of hospital birth, ask any of the more 
					than 25,000 L &amp; D nurses in the United States. These nurses are highly 
					skilled professionals who do what is really an impossible job. They 
					must monitor the laboring woman and assist at the birth, all the while 
					keeping the doctor happy and covering up for the fact that the doctor 
					is not there most of the time and in most cases makes a minor 
					contribution to the birth. The fact that defines and limits these 
					nurses is that they have no autonomy and can do nothing without 
					doctors' orders.
                </p>
                <p>
					Because American obstetricians have always had L &amp; D nurses to do 
					their bidding, now that midwifery is gradually but steadily returning 
					in this country obstetricians have developed a distorted understanding 
					of midwifery. Obstetricians believe midwives are obstetrical 
					assistants and keep trying to give them orders. But the practice of 
					midwifery is very different from the practice of nursing.
                </p>
                <p>
					Midwives are autonomous professionals who provide primary maternity 
					care and are analogous to family physicians who provide primary health 
					care. If the family physician hears a heart murmur and refers the 
					patient to a specialist cardiologist, this does not mean the family 
					physician is the cardiologist's assistant and somehow less competent, 
					but only that the cardiologist has a different expertise—an expertise 
					for certain complications—than the family physician has. The 
					cardiologist makes suggestions for treatment of the family physician's 
					patient, which the family physician and patient may or may not choose 
					to follow. The cardiologist and the family physician are professional 
					equals who collaborate with mutual respect to provide the best quality 
					care for the patient.
                </p>
                <p>
					By the same token, a specialist obstetrician does not give orders to a 
					midwife any more than a cardiologist gives orders to a family 
					physician. The midwife may refer a woman to an obstetrician because of 
					a complication, but this does not make the midwife the obstetrician's 
					assistant. The midwife and obstetrician then collaborate as 
					professional equals.
                </p>
                <p>
					Too many obstetricians still don't get it and continue trying to boss 
					midwives around, hiring and firing them from their practices, pushing 
					them off hospital staffs and accusing them of practicing medicine 
					without a license. If you are pregnant, don't allow yourself to get 
					in the middle of this professional turf struggle. If you want a 
					midwife to provide your primary maternity care, find one who has as 
					much autonomy as possible in her practice. If you are considering 
					having a particular obstetrician provide your primary maternity care, 
					a good way to measure that doctor's openness and attitude toward you 
					and women in general is to inquire what his or her opinion is of 
					midwifery.
                </p>
                <p>
					Another reason midwives are safer than doctors is because midwives use 
					far less unnecessary technology. Because obstetricians are surgeons, 
					they turn birth into a surgical procedure. Proof of this is that the 
					birthing woman is treated as if she is a surgical patient: she is put 
					on her back in a bed that is really a modified surgical table, often 
					with her legs up in surgical stirrups. For more than 25 years we have 
					known scientifically that this is the worst of all possible positions 
					for a woman giving birth; in this position the baby's head compresses 
					the woman's main blood vessel that supplies the womb and the baby and 
					reduces the blood and oxygen going to the baby. If the woman is in a 
					vertical position (sitting, squatting or standing), more blood and 
					oxygen flow to the baby, the woman's bony pelvis opens more to let the 
					baby out and she gives birth downhill instead of uphill against 
					gravity. One way to find out if a hospital is practicing modern 
					maternity care or not is simply to see what position women are put 
					in during birth. If hospital staff are still putting women on their 
					backs during birth, they are ignoring all scientific data and still 
					pretending birth is a surgical procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
					Between 50 percent and 80 percent of births in most American 
					hospitals involve one or more surgical procedures, further proof 
					that obstetricians have turned birth into a surgical event. Those 
					procedures include drugs to start or speed up labor, episiotomy 
					(cutting the genitals with surgical scissors to widen the vaginal 
					opening), placing metal forceps or a vacuum extractor on the baby's 
					head to pull the baby out (you can imagine the risks involved in this), 
					and cesarean section to cut the baby out. In reality, any of these 
					surgical procedures is necessary in no more than 20 percent of all 
					births. And since all surgical procedures carry risks, the high 
					frequency of their unnecessary use in physician-attended births leads 
					to more dead and damaged babies than would ever occur in midwife - 
					attended births. Large numbers of research reports document that 
					midwives use far fewer surgical interventions than doctors. A case 
					in point is the use of episiotomy. From half to three-quarters of 
					all women in America birthing their first baby in the hospital with 
					the assistance of a doctor have this surgical cut done to their 
					genitals. It is scientifically proven that no more than 20 percent of 
					women will need this cut; the best rate is about 5 percent. Among 
					midwives in independent practice in the United States (that is, when 
					doctors are not giving midwives orders as to what to do), between 2 
					percent and 20 percent of women undergo episiotomy.
                </p>
                <p>
					Is the fact important that midwives cut far fewer episiotomies than 
					doctors cut? Scientific evidence shows that having an episiotomy means 
					more bleeding, more pain, more permanent deformity of the vagina, and 
					more painful sexual intercourse for months, or even years. As well, 
					unnecessary episiotomy is a form of sexual abuse. Some women's groups 
					in America are rightly concerned about the practice of female genital 
					mutilation in parts of Africa. They need to be equally concerned about 
					the millions of American women who have suffered female genital 
					mutilation—unnecessary cutting of the genitals at birth at the 
					hands of doctors.
                </p>
                <p>
					While midwives trust women's bodies, use such low-tech assistance as 
					the skilled use of their hands, and understand the importance of 
					preserving normalcy, doctors, in general, do not trust women but 
					trust drugs and machines, use high-tech assistance, and focus on the 
					pursuit of abnormality. So having a highly trained surgeon 
					obstetrician assist at your birth is about as sensible as hiring a 
					pediatric surgeon as a baby sitter for your healthy 2 year old when 
					you go out in the evening. Like the obstetric surgeon who gives the 
					normal woman a shot to hurry her labor, the pediatric surgeon baby - 
					sitting your normal child will focus on medical management: when your 
					robust 2 year old gets tired and fussy, the pediatric surgeon will 
					give him or her a shot to hurry the child to sleep. The result? In 
					the one case you get the medicalization of birth (remember, birth is 
					not an illness), with a lot of unnecessary risky interventions and 
					very expensive medical care, and in the other case you get the 
					medicalization of childhood (being 2 years old is also not an 
					illness), with unnecessary risky interventions and very expensive 
					baby - sitting.
                </p>
                <p>
					When deciding on your primary maternity care provider, it is important 
					to ask midwives or doctors about their practices: find out if they 
					prefer to put you on your back during birth and how often they do 
					episiotomy, forceps or vacuum extraction, and cesarean section. If 
					they don't know their rates of surgical interventions or refuse to 
					tell you what their rates are, look out! Beware of any tendency to 
					patronize you, to suggest that you cannot possibly understand all 
					this technical stuff, or that you should just " trust me, I'm the 
					doctor."
