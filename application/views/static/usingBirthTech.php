                    A woman in Iowa was recently referred to a university hospital during 
                    her labor because of possible complications. There, it was decided that 
                    a cesarean section should be done. After the surgery was completed and 
                    the woman was resting post-operatively in her hospital room, she went 
                    into shock and died. An autopsy showed that during the cesarean section 
                    the surgeon had accidentally nicked the woman's aorta, the biggest 
                    artery in the body, leading to internal hemorrhage, shock and death.
                </p>
                <p>
					Cesarean section can save the life of the mother or her baby. Cesarean 
					section can also kill a mother or her baby. How can this be? Because 
					every single procedure or technology used during pregnancy and birth 
					carries risks, both for mother and baby. The decision to use technology 
					is a judgment call - it may make things either better or worse.
                </p>
                <p>
					We are living in the age of technology. Ever since we succeeded in 
					going to the moon, we have believed that technology can do everything 
					to solve all of our problems. So it should come as no surprise that 
					doctors and hospitals are using more and more technology on pregnant 
					and birthing women. Has it solved all the problems that can arise 
					during birth? Hardly. Let's look at the recent track record.
                </p>
                <p>
					Has the recent increasing use of technology during pregnancy and birth 
					resulted in fewer damaged or dead babies? In the United States there 
					has been no decrease in the past 30 years in the number of babies with 
					cerebral palsy. The biggest killer of newborn babies is a birth weight 
					that is too low, but the number of too-small babies born has not 
					decreased the past 20 years. The number of babies who die while still 
					in the womb has not decreased in more than a decade. While the past 10 
					years has seen a slight drop in the number of babies who die during 
					their first week after birth, the scientific data suggest an increase 
					in the number of babies who survive the first week but have permanent 
					brain damage.
                </p>
                <p>
					Is the increasing use of technology saving the lives of more pregnant 
					and birthing women? In the United States the scientific data show no 
					decrease during the past 10 years in the number of women who die 
					around the time of birth (maternal mortality). In fact, recent data 
					suggest a frightening increase in the number of women dying during 
					pregnancy and birth in the United States. So it may be that the 
					increase in the use of birth technologies is not only not saving more 
					women's lives but it is also killing more women. This possibility has 
					a reasonable scientific explanation: cesarean section and epidural 
					anesthesia have both been used more and more in this country and we 
					know that both cesarean section and epidural block can result in death.
                </p>
                <p>
					We should not be surprised with the recent poor track record of high - 
					tech birth. For many decades in the middle of the 20th century the 
					number of babies dying around the time of birth was decreasing. This 
					was due not to medical advances but mainly to such social advances as 
					less severe poverty, better nutrition and better housing. Most 
					important, the decrease in mortality was due to family planning, 
					resulting in fewer women with many pregnancies and births. Medical 
					care also was responsible for some of the decreasing mortality of 
					babies, not because of high-tech interventions but because of basic 
					medical advances, such as the discovery of antibiotics and the ability 
					to give safe blood transfusions. There has never been any scientific 
					evidence that high-tech interventions such as the routine use of 
					electronic fetal monitoring during labor decrease the mortality rate 
					of babies.
                </p>
                <p>
					What this means is that putting yourself in the hands of a high-tech 
					doctor and a high-tech hospital does not guarantee you the safest 
					birth. You must yourself take responsibility for your own birth, 
					including the decision to have technology used on you and your baby. 
					Remember, technology is not good or bad. How technology is used can 
					be good or bad. Airplanes can be used to carry you to visit your 
					family or can be used to drop bombs on women and children. How 
					technology is used on you during pregnancy and birth is of great 
					importance because it can help you and your baby or harm you and your 
					baby.
                </p>

					How to Get the Right Technology
                </h2>
                <h4>
					Choosing Your Maternity Care Provider
                </h4>
                <p>
					How do you go about being pregnant and giving birth in circumstances 
					where the use of technology is appropriate and right for you, your 
					baby and your family? The first step is to get the right health care 
					professional to assist you during the pregnancy and birth. A key 
					decision is to decide if your primary maternity care provider is to 
					be a midwife, a family physician or an obstetrician.
                </p>
                <p>
					The United States and Canada are the only countries in the world where 
					highly trained surgeons called obstetricians attend the majority of 
					normal births. The American obstetrician is to be pitied. He or she 
					is trying to be all things to all women - primary maternity care 
					provider for normal, healthy pregnant and birthing women, specialist 
					in complications of pregnancy and birth, specialist in women's 
					diseases and highly skilled surgeon. No other doctor anywhere in the 
					realm of health care tries to maintain competency at all these levels 
					and in so many areas because it is totally unreasonable to expect 
					this from one human being. Can an obstetrician do a six-hour "pelvic 
					clean out" gynecological surgical procedure on a woman with extensive 
					cancer, then rush to his or her office and do the best job of quietly 
					and patiently counseling a pregnant woman about her sex life? Not 
					likely.
                </p>
                <p>
					While American obstetricians have worked hard to convince the public 
					they are the safest people to assist at all births, the scientific 
					evidence does not support them. For example, a large scientific study 
					published in 1998 looked at all births in the United States in one 
					year - more than four million births. Because doctors really do need to 
					manage the few births that develop serious complications, the study  
					eliminated complicated births and looked only at low - risk births. 
					Compared with physician-attended low - risk births, midwife - attended  
					low risk births have 33 percent (one-third) fewer deaths among  
					newborn infants. Furthermore, midwife - attended births have 31 percent  
					(nearly one-third) fewer babies born too small, which means fewer  
					retarded and brain-damaged infants. 
                </p>
                <p>
					There is not a single report in the scientific literature that shows 
					obstetricians to be safer than midwives for low - risk or normal 
					pregnancy and birth. So if you are among the more than 75 percent of 
					all women with a normal pregnancy, the safest birth attendant for you  
					is not a doctor but a midwife.
                </p>
                <p>
					If you are considering a hospital birth with an obstetrician as your 
					primary birth attendant, ask him or her how much time he or she will 
					spend with you during your labor. One of the reasons a midwife is 
					generally a better choice to attend your hospital birth than an 
					obstetrician is because the midwife is there in the hospital with you 
					during your labor while the obstetrician is not. It is an incredible 
					irony that the obstetrician insists that the woman who is his or her 
					client give birth only in the hospital, while the obstetrician who 
					should attend her birth is not in the hospital. If your obstetrician 
					is not with you in the hospital during labor, then where is your 
					obstetrician?
                </p>
                <p>
					For 50 years now the United States has had a system of maternity care 
					in which the woman goes into labor, goes to the hospital, is admitted 
					by a labor and delivery nurse (L &amp; D nurse) who examines the woman 
					and calls the obstetrician, who is either at home or in his or her 
					office (usually seeing normal, healthy pregnant women). The 
					obstetrician gives orders over the telephone to the nurse, who then 
					assists the woman during her labor. The obstetrician may or may not 
					come by the hospital sometime during the labor to briefly check the 
					woman. But it is the job of the L &amp; D nurse to monitor the labor and 
					call the obstetrician when the birth is imminent so that the doctor 
					can rush in, catch the baby at the last minute and get all the credit 
					(and money) for "delivering" the baby. If the nurse calls the 
					obstetrician too soon and the doctor has to hang around the hospital 
					waiting for the birth, the doctor is angry with the nurse for wasting 
					his time. But if the nurse calls the obstetrician too late and the 
					baby is born before the doctor gets there, the doctor is furious with 
					the nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
					Why is it important to insist that your obstetrician be with you 
					during your labor as well as at the birth? In a study of obstetrical 
					malpractice cases involving permanent brain damage of the baby, the 
					absence of the obstetrician from the hospital during the labor played 
					a central role in causing the tragedy in approximately two - thirds of 
					the cases. This research showed that telephone conversations during a 
					hospital birth between nurses at the hospital and the doctor who was 
					not in the hospital gave rise to misunderstanding or miscommunication 
					that caused adverse effects for the mother or baby. If you choose an 
					obstetrician as your primary birth attendant and he/she cannot 
					guarantee that he/she or another obstetrician will be physically 
					present (not just on call) during your labor as well as the birth, 
					you are wasting your money and putting your baby in danger, and you 
					need to get another birth attendant.
                </p>
                <p>
					If you doubt this description of hospital birth, ask any of the more 
					than 25,000 L &amp; D nurses in the United States. These nurses are highly 
					skilled professionals who do what is really an impossible job. They 
					must monitor the laboring woman and assist at the birth, all the while 
					keeping the doctor happy and covering up for the fact that the doctor 
					is not there most of the time and in most cases makes a minor 
					contribution to the birth. The fact that defines and limits these 
					nurses is that they have no autonomy and can do nothing without 
					doctors' orders.
                </p>
                <p>
					Because American obstetricians have always had L &amp; D nurses to do 
					their bidding, now that midwifery is gradually but steadily returning 
					in this country obstetricians have developed a distorted understanding 
					of midwifery. Obstetricians believe midwives are obstetrical 
					assistants and keep trying to give them orders. But the practice of 
					midwifery is very different from the practice of nursing.
                </p>
                <p>
					Midwives are autonomous professionals who provide primary maternity 
					care and are analogous to family physicians who provide primary health 
					care. If the family physician hears a heart murmur and refers the 
					patient to a specialist cardiologist, this does not mean the family 
					physician is the cardiologist's assistant and somehow less competent, 
					but only that the cardiologist has a different expertise—an expertise 
					for certain complications—than the family physician has. The 
					cardiologist makes suggestions for treatment of the family physician's 
					patient, which the family physician and patient may or may not choose 
					to follow. The cardiologist and the family physician are professional 
					equals who collaborate with mutual respect to provide the best quality 
					care for the patient.
                </p>
                <p>
					By the same token, a specialist obstetrician does not give orders to a 
					midwife any more than a cardiologist gives orders to a family 
					physician. The midwife may refer a woman to an obstetrician because of 
					a complication, but this does not make the midwife the obstetrician's 
					assistant. The midwife and obstetrician then collaborate as 
					professional equals.
                </p>
                <p>
					Too many obstetricians still don't get it and continue trying to boss 
					midwives around, hiring and firing them from their practices, pushing 
					them off hospital staffs and accusing them of practicing medicine 
					without a license. If you are pregnant, don't allow yourself to get 
					in the middle of this professional turf struggle. If you want a 
					midwife to provide your primary maternity care, find one who has as 
					much autonomy as possible in her practice. If you are considering 
					having a particular obstetrician provide your primary maternity care, 
					a good way to measure that doctor's openness and attitude toward you 
					and women in general is to inquire what his or her opinion is of 
					midwifery.
                </p>
                <p>
					Another reason midwives are safer than doctors is because midwives use 
					far less unnecessary technology. Because obstetricians are surgeons, 
					they turn birth into a surgical procedure. Proof of this is that the 
					birthing woman is treated as if she is a surgical patient: she is put 
					on her back in a bed that is really a modified surgical table, often 
					with her legs up in surgical stirrups. For more than 25 years we have 
					known scientifically that this is the worst of all possible positions 
					for a woman giving birth; in this position the baby's head compresses 
					the woman's main blood vessel that supplies the womb and the baby and 
					reduces the blood and oxygen going to the baby. If the woman is in a 
					vertical position (sitting, squatting or standing), more blood and 
					oxygen flow to the baby, the woman's bony pelvis opens more to let the 
					baby out and she gives birth downhill instead of uphill against 
					gravity. One way to find out if a hospital is practicing modern 
					maternity care or not is simply to see what position women are put 
					in during birth. If hospital staff are still putting women on their 
					backs during birth, they are ignoring all scientific data and still 
					pretending birth is a surgical procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
					Between 50 percent and 80 percent of births in most American 
					hospitals involve one or more surgical procedures, further proof 
					that obstetricians have turned birth into a surgical event. Those 
					procedures include drugs to start or speed up labor, episiotomy 
					(cutting the genitals with surgical scissors to widen the vaginal 
					opening), placing metal forceps or a vacuum extractor on the baby's 
					head to pull the baby out (you can imagine the risks involved in this), 
					and cesarean section to cut the baby out. In reality, any of these 
					surgical procedures is necessary in no more than 20 percent of all 
					births. And since all surgical procedures carry risks, the high 
					frequency of their unnecessary use in physician-attended births leads 
					to more dead and damaged babies than would ever occur in midwife - 
					attended births. Large numbers of research reports document that 
					midwives use far fewer surgical interventions than doctors. A case 
					in point is the use of episiotomy. From half to three-quarters of 
					all women in America birthing their first baby in the hospital with 
					the assistance of a doctor have this surgical cut done to their 
					genitals. It is scientifically proven that no more than 20 percent of 
					women will need this cut; the best rate is about 5 percent. Among 
					midwives in independent practice in the United States (that is, when 
					doctors are not giving midwives orders as to what to do), between 2 
					percent and 20 percent of women undergo episiotomy.
                </p>
                <p>
					Is the fact important that midwives cut far fewer episiotomies than 
					doctors cut? Scientific evidence shows that having an episiotomy means 
					more bleeding, more pain, more permanent deformity of the vagina, and 
					more painful sexual intercourse for months, or even years. As well, 
					unnecessary episiotomy is a form of sexual abuse. Some women's groups 
					in America are rightly concerned about the practice of female genital 
					mutilation in parts of Africa. They need to be equally concerned about 
					the millions of American women who have suffered female genital 
					mutilation - unnecessary cutting of the genitals at birth at the 
					hands of doctors.
                </p>
                <p>
					While midwives trust women's bodies, use such low-tech assistance as 
					the skilled use of their hands, and understand the importance of 
					preserving normalcy, doctors, in general, do not trust women but 
					trust drugs and machines, use high-tech assistance, and focus on the 
					pursuit of abnormality. So having a highly trained surgeon 
					obstetrician assist at your birth is about as sensible as hiring a 
					pediatric surgeon as a baby sitter for your healthy 2 year old when 
					you go out in the evening. Like the obstetric surgeon who gives the 
					normal woman a shot to hurry her labor, the pediatric surgeon baby - 
					sitting your normal child will focus on medical management: when your 
					robust 2 year old gets tired and fussy, the pediatric surgeon will 
					give him or her a shot to hurry the child to sleep. The result? In 
					the one case you get the medicalization of birth (remember, birth is 
					not an illness), with a lot of unnecessary risky interventions and 
					very expensive medical care, and in the other case you get the 
					medicalization of childhood (being 2 years old is also not an 
					illness), with unnecessary risky interventions and very expensive 
					baby - sitting.
                </p>
                <p>
					When deciding on your primary maternity care provider, it is important 
					to ask midwives or doctors about their practices: find out if they 
					prefer to put you on your back during birth and how often they do 
					episiotomy, forceps or vacuum extraction, and cesarean section. If 
					they don't know their rates of surgical interventions or refuse to 
					tell you what their rates are, look out! Beware of any tendency to 
					patronize you, to suggest that you cannot possibly understand all 
					this technical stuff, or that you should just " trust me, I'm the 
					doctor."
                </p>
                <h4>
					Choosing the Right Place to Give Birth
                </h4>
                <p>
					An important decision to make is whether to have your birth at home, 
					a freestanding birth center or a hospital. Overwhelming scientific 
					evidence shows that the home is a perfectly safe place to give birth 
					if you are one of the more than 80 percent of women who have had no 
					serious medical complications during pregnancy. The evidence indicates 
					that it is important to have a trained birth attendant for your 
					homebirth, be it non-nurse midwife, nurse-midwife or doctor. Your 
					place of birth should also be within 30 minutes of the nearest 
					hospital. The single most important advantage of homebirth is that 
					the birthing woman is in control. Another important advantage is that 
					in homebirth there is far less unnecessary use of technology. For a 
					hospital to say it can be "homelike" is like the sign in the bakery 
					window: "We sell home-baked bread."
                </p>
                <p>
					A freestanding birth center staffed with midwives is also a perfectly 
					legitimate choice for the great majority of women who have had no 
					serious complications during their pregnancy. But don't be fooled by 
					the hospital that advertises its "birth center." If the birth center 
					is not freestanding (i.e., outside the hospital) it will still be under 
					the supervision of the hospital and the doctors, and the birthing 
					woman will not be in control. Plenty of scientific evidence confirms 
					that a freestanding birth center with midwives is a safe option. For 
					example, a study of more than 10,000 women giving birth in more than 
					80 freestanding birth centers in the United States showed birth in 
					these centers to be just as safe as a matched group of low-risk 
					hospital births.
                </p>
                <p>
					Be sure to investigate the practices in any hospital you may consider 
					for your birth. Would you have the freedom to have the kind of birth 
					you wish? Remember, freedom means being in control of everything that 
					happens to you. Being given permission to do this but not that is not 
					freedom. Can you invite anyone you want to be present at the birth? 
					Some hospitals will limit whom you can bring. Meanwhile they 
					can (without asking you) bring anyone they want to your birth, 
					including, for example, a bunch of doctors in training. Can you come 
					with a written birth plan that they will respect and honor, or will 
					they have an obvious attitude about such plans and consider you a 
					"bad patient"? Many hospitals are competing for patients and will 
					show pregnant women beautiful "birthing rooms." Remember, what is 
					important is not a rocking chair and pretty curtains but whether 
					or not you can be in control.
                </p>
                <p>
					Always be aware that hospitals are under the absolute control of 
					doctors and that the rules and regulations are for the convenience 
					of the staff, not you. Hospitals are designed to care for sick people, 
					and since a birthing woman is not sick, much of what goes on in the 
					hospital doesn't fit her needs. One simple example: most births take 
					from 10 to 20 hours, during which there is one or more turnover of 
					staff, who are on eight-hour shifts. While the data show the 
					overwhelming importance of a woman having the continuous assistance 
					of someone she knows throughout her labor, during your hospital birth 
					you are likely to have to cope with one or more staff changes and lots 
					of strangers coming into your room.
                </p>
                <p>
					Ask the hospital if women are put on their backs during birth. Ask 
					for the hospital's rate of episiotomies, forceps deliveries and 
					cesarean sections. Don't be satisfied with the usual answer: "It 
					varies by doctor." Don't believe them if they say they don't have 
					their hospital cesarean-section rate; they are required in most 
					states to report this rate to the State Health Department. In New 
					York state a law provides the right to be given all this information, 
					and an official pamphlet given out to all newly pregnant women 
					includes a listing of the cesarean-section rate for every hospital 
					in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
					Some of you belong to a health plan that may limit your choice of 
					maternity care provider and place of birth. In this case you may have 
					to get aggressive to get what you really want. Don't be afraid to 
					demand what should absolutely be your right as a family and a birthing 
					woman. Besides, a health plan is a business that needs to keep its 
					customers happy. If your health maintenance organization (HMO) doesn't 
					have a midwife and you want one, demand one. If you want an 
					out-of-hospital birth and your HMO doesn't provide it, demand it. 
					More and more HMOs now have midwives because they are discovering 
					midwives are just as safe as doctors and cost the HMO a lot less. 
					The largest HMO in New Mexico, for example, has more midwives than 
					obstetricians on their full-time staff, and around 80 percent of all 
					hospital births in this HMO are attended only by midwives.
                </p>
                <h2>
					Getting Information on the Technologies
                </h2>
                <h4>
					How to Get the Information
                </h4>
                <p>
					When considering whether a given technology is appropriate for you, 
					it is important that you understand the difference between facts and 
					value judgments. The probability (chance) that using the technology 
					will make things better (efficacy) and the probability (chance) that 
					using the technology will make things worse (risk) are facts that can 
					be scientifically measured. But benefit and safety are value judgments 
					about the acceptability of those chances. To be appropriate, both the 
					benefit and the safety of technology must be judged by those on whom 
					it is used. Scientists can measure the efficacy and risks, midwives 
					and doctors can inform the woman of the data on these two chances 
					(better or worse) but the person taking the chances (the patient) 
					is the only one who can legitimately decide whether one chance 
					outweighs the other. It is thus inappropriate and dangerous for a 
					doctor or midwife to tell a patient that something is "safe" when it 
					is not the doctor or midwife taking the chances. Instead, the role of 
					the doctor and midwife is limited to suggesting possible interventions 
					and explaining the chances that the intervention will make you better 
					or worse.
                </p>
                <p>
					Whenever someone suggests using a technology on you, you must leave 
					no stone unturned in finding out what your chances are for getting 
					better or worse. It is the duty of any doctor, midwife or nurse to 
					provide you with full information on these two chances. However, you 
					must accept the responsibility for getting full information because 
					you cannot always rely on your maternity care provider to volunteer 
					such information. If it is not forthcoming and complete, you must 
					demand it. Every effort must be made to get full, honest information. 
					Because your wishes and the wishes of the doctor may often collide, 
					it is sometimes difficult to get unbiased information. Too often, the 
					doctor provides only that part of the information he or she thinks 
					will make you a more compliant patient who will agree with whatever 
					the doctor wants and, therefore, suggests. One way to get unbiased 
					information is to insist on seeing the scientific data behind any 
					information given you. "Show me the data" is a powerful strategy for 
					eliciting better information. Another important way to get more 
					unbiased information is to demand a second opinion, which can, one 
					hopes, provide a second source of information.

					A powerful shortcut to finding out if a particular technology is 
					likely to be helpful to you is provided by the six tables at the 
					end of a book by Enkin et al. titled <i><b>A Guide to Effective Care in 
					Pregnancy and Childbirth</b></i>. All the most common interventions used 
					during pregnancy and birth are classified as follows depending on a 
					careful review of the scientific evidence for each intervention: 1) 
					beneficial, 2) likely to be beneficial, 3) trade-off between 
					beneficial and adverse effects, 4) unknown effectiveness, 5) 
					unlikely to be beneficial, 6) ineffective or harmful. A glance at 
					this last table is quite informative. You might want to check on how 
					many of these ineffective or harmful interventions are still in use 
					in any hospital you are considering.

					Information on Prenatal Technologies
                </h4>
                <p>
					The process of getting information on a technology can be tricky, so 
					a couple of examples will be given to illustrate how to go about it. 
					While pregnant, you might find it a good idea to test your skills at 
					getting information on a technology and to see how willing the 
					midwife, nurse or doctor is to provide full, unbiased information.
                </p>
                <p>
					It is likely that a routine ultrasound scan will be suggested fairly 
					early in your pregnancy. This presents a perfect opportunity to ask a 
					few questions" "What is the chance the scan will make things worse? 
					Is such a scan safe?" If the answer is a flat "Yes, ultrasound 
					scanning during pregnancy is safe," alarm bells should start going 
					off in your head, because you are not getting the full information. 
					You must then ask, "Show me the data on the safety of prenatal 
					ultrasound," in order to check on what you may be told about the 
					data on the safety of prenatal ultrasound. As a scientist I can 
					assure you that the only correct answer to your question is, "We 
					don't know because there is not sufficient scientific data to prove 
					the safety of prenatal ultrasound." Some research has shown the 
					possibility that ultrasound can cause slowed growth of the fetus 
					while still in the uterus. Other research has shown the possibility 
					that some children who have been scanned while still in the uterus 
					may later have mild neurological deficits. We need more study of both 
					these possibilities. But from a scientific viewpoint, it is impossible 
					to say today that ultrasound scanning during pregnancy is perfectly 
					safe.
                </p>
                <p>
					The next question to ask when ultrasound scanning is proposed to you 
					is, "What is the chance that a scan will make things better?" When you 
					are told that one reason for the scan is to look for defects in the 
					fetus, ask: "What is the chance a defect will be correctly identified 
					(true positive screening test) and what is the chance a defect will be 
					incorrectly identified (false positive screening test)?" If your 
					provider cannot, or will not, answer this question, watch out! Again, 
					so that you can check on what you may be told, here is the best 
					scientific data: If 100 pregnancies are routinely screened with 
					ultrasound to look for a defective fetus, two out of the 100 will 
					have a true positive result (i.e., the scan says the fetus is 
					defective, and it truly is defective), and one out of the 100 will 
					have a false positive result (i.e., the scan says the fetus is 
					defective, but it is not defective, it is a normal fetus). So if 
					all women with a positive scan are offered therapeutic abortion, 
					for every two defective fetuses aborted, one normal fetus will be 
					aborted. How many women are told this before they are offered a 
					routine prenatal ultrasound scan?
                </p>
                <p>
					Your next question when ultrasound is suggested should be, "Is there 
					a better chance my baby will survive the pregnancy and birth if an 
					ultrasound scan is done, and what are the data?" The correct answer 
					is that a large study in the United States of more than 15,000 regnant 
					women showed no improvement in the mortality rate of the babies if 
					ultrasound is routinely used during pregnancy.
                </p>
                <p>
					One scientist published the following summary of the present state of 
					the art on routine prenatal ultrasound scanning: "The casual observer 
					might be forgiven for wondering why the medical profession is now 
					involved in the wholesale examination of pregnant patients with 
					machines emanating vastly different powers of energy which is not 
					proven to be harmless to obtain information which is not proven to 
					be of any clinical value by operators who are not certified as 
					competent to perform the examinations." For all these reasons, 
					the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the 
					American College of Radiology and the U.S. government's Preventive 
					Services Task Force all recommend against routine ultrasound 
					screening of low-risk pregnancies. This is the type of unbiased, 
					scientifically sound information you need to make informed choices 
					about technology used on you during pregnancy.
                </p>
                <h4>
					Information on Technologies Used During Birth
                </h4>
                <p>
					Because a situation may arise during birth where time constraints 
					limit the opportunity to get full information on a technology or 
					procedure being proposed for use on you, it is wise to look long 
					before your due date at the information on certain technologies 
					used frequently during birth. Brief mention already has been made 
					of episiotomy, the surgical cutting of women's genitals.
                </p>
                <p>
					Since in American hospitals 20 percent or more of woman do not give 
					birth but instead the baby is cut out with cesarean section, you need 
					information on this technology in advance of your birthing. There is 
					no better example of the surgical approach to birth than cesarean 
					section, because it is the ultimate solution of all surgeons—cut it 
					out. Some obstetricians are so enamored of this technical solution to 
					birth that they are now promoting it as preferable to the normal way 
					of giving birth through the vagina.
                </p>
                <p>
					One recent article in a prominent medical journal seriously proposed 
					the routine surgical removal, by cesarean section, of all babies, 
					together with a policy that would require a signed release from any 
					woman so foolish as to insist on vaginal birth. Another paper 
					published in an authoritative medical journal tried to show, using 
					very biased data, that efforts to reduce cesarean section in the 
					United States below 20 percent would be dangerous, a proposal that 
					goes against a massive amount of good scientific data. A third article 
					in a medical journal insisted women have the right to demand cesarean 
					section birth even when there is no medical reason for it.
                </p>
                <p>
					Meanwhile, a recent popular book for the public urges women in the 
					United States to request a routine cesarean section birth because 
					they "want to maintain the vaginal tone of a teenager and their 
					doctors can find a medical explanation that will suit the insurance 
					company." So a tight vagina for your sexual partner should be your 
					first concern, and it's okay for your doctor to lie and cheat the 
					insurance company. The surgical approach to birth has run amok!
                </p>
                <p>
					What is the truth, scientifically, about cesarean section? Compare 
					what you are told with the following scientifically documented 
					information. Again, while getting information on this major surgical 
					procedure, the first question is, "How safe is cesarean section?" 
					Always beware of any attempts to pooh-pooh the question or downplay 
					the risks. We are talking about major abdominal surgery that carries 
					major risks. Starting with the risks to the woman, she has a four to 
					eight times greater chance of dying from a cesarean section than she 
					does giving birth through her vagina. Even a routine, scheduled 
					cesarean section with no medical complication as the reason for 
					the surgery carries a two times greater risk that the woman will 
					die from the surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
					Even if the woman does not die, she is at risk for many serious 
					complications from the surgery, such as the accidental cutting of 
					her bladder or other internal organs and a 20 percent chance she 
					will get an infection as a result of the surgery. Since the woman 
					often gets a fever with this infection, her fever necessitates a 
					fever diagnostic work-up of her infant, with blood tests and even 
					spinal tap of the baby.
                </p>
                <p>
					Having a cesarean birth also affects the future reproductive 
					possibilities of the woman, because having a cesarean section 
					means she has a decreased chance of ever getting pregnant again. 
					And if she does get pregnant again, she is at higher risk that her 
					pregnancy will occur outside her womb, a condition that will never 
					result in a live baby and is life threatening for the woman. If in 
					her subsequent pregnancies she succeeds in making it to the end of 
					pregnancy and goes into labor, she is also at higher risk of two 
					serious complications during the birth, both of which can threaten 
					her own life and the life of the baby: a placenta that blocks the 
					outlet for the baby or a placenta that detaches itself before the 
					baby is born.
                </p>
                <p>
					While some women might be willing to take risks with their own body, 
					it would be very hard to find a woman willing to take risks with the 
					life or health of her baby just for her own convenience or to avoid 
					labor pain. So the following risks to the baby born by cesarean 
					section are of great importance. There is about a 5 percent chance 
					that when the surgeon cuts into the woman's body during a cesarean 
					section, the knife will accidentally also cut her baby. Because all 
					the water is not squeezed out of the baby's lungs as is normally 
					done during a vaginal birth, more babies born after cesarean section 
					develop serious respiratory distress syndrome, one of the biggest 
					killers of newborn babies. Because doctors are not as good as they 
					would like to be in estimating, even with ultrasound, the baby's 
					gestational age (i.e., whether the pregnancy has gone long enough) too 
					often a cesarean section is done too soon, resulting in a premature 
					birth. Prematurity is a big killer of newborn babies and also carries 
					a higher risk of brain damage to the baby. It is difficult to imagine 
					that a woman who has been given full information on these risks to 
					herself and her baby would still choose a cesarean section when there 
					is no serious medical reason for it. Obstetricians have jumped on the 
					"woman's choice" bandwagon, which in many ways is a good thing except 
					for the tendency to push women's choice only for things the 
					obstetricians want to do anyway. For example, for years the 
					scientific evidence has favored vaginal birth after an earlier 
					cesarean section (called VBAC) rather than a repeat cesarean section. 
					Doctors, however, have never really pushed VBAC, but instead emphasize 
					a repeat cesarean. Pushing women to have the right to choose major 
					surgery for which there is no medical indication is ridiculous as 
					well as dangerous. It has been established legally and ethically 
					that patients have the right to refuse treatment even when medically 
					indicated, but patients have never had the right to choose medical 
					or surgical treatment that is not indicated. Doctors are under no 
					obligation to do unjustified major surgery. Women's "choice" is 
					clearly limited to medically valid options.
                </p>
                <p>
					There has been an epidemic of unnecessary cesarean section births  
					because doctors like a quick, surgical solution for birth. Now another
					birth technology, epidural block for labor pain, is seeing a rapid 
					expansion of epidemic proportions because doctors are selling it to 
					women as hard as they can. (Epidural block for cesarean section is 
					another matter, as it is the preferred anesthesia for this major 
					surgery.) A new subspecialty of doctors, obstetric anesthesiologists, is 
					built entirely on the economic foundation of epidural block for normal 
					labor pain. They need lots of birthing women to choose this form of 
					pain relief if these doctors are to make a grand living. (Their 
					professional journal contains advertisements for purchasing private 
					jets.) These new specialists go to prenatal classes to sell epidural 
					block and prowl the halls of hospital maternity wards, popping in on 
					women in labor to sell their epidural block. Their hard sell includes 
					telling women that epidural block is "safe." How safe is it really?
                </p>
                <p>
					Twenty-three percent, or nearly one in four women, given an epidural 
					block will develop a complication. One undesirable complication is 
					death - epidural block for relief of normal labor pain results in a 
					three times higher mortality rate for the woman than labor without 
					epidural block. One out of every 500 epidural blocks results in 
					temporary neurological problems, such as paralysis in the woman; 
					and in one out of every half-million epidural blocks, this 
					neurological damage to the woman is permanent.
                </p>
                <p>
					These extremely serious risks of epidural block are not so common, 
					but several less serious, but still significant, risks are much more 
					common. Fifteen percent to 20 percent of all women given epidural 
					block develop fever that results in the undesirable necessity of 
					administering diagnostic tests and antibiotic treatment to the baby. 
					Fifteen percent to thirty-five percent of all women given epidural 
					block cannot urinate and must have a tube inserted into their bladder. 
					Thirty percent to 40 percent of all women given epidural block have 
					severe backache for hours or days after birth, and 20 percent still 
					have severe backache one year later. So they have traded pain relief 
					during a few hours of labor for severe back pain for a year or more! 
					Because labor pain is an essential component of the normal mechanisms 
					of the body for the progress of labor and since the epidural block 
					eliminates this necessary pain, epidurals also eliminate the normal 
					mechanisms for the progress of labor. So it is to be expected that 
					considerable research documents a longer labor if the woman is given 
					epidural block. As normal labor is no longer possible with epidural 
					block, there is four times greater use of forceps or vacuum extraction 
					and at least twice as much cesarean section after epidural block. 
					These surgical interventions, of course, carry their own risks both 
					for woman and baby. So the woman choosing epidural block trades 
					less labor pain for a longer labor and, if a cesarean section is 
					done, more pain for several days after the birth, as well as 
					increased risks for both herself and her baby.
                </p>
                <p>
					Thus, epidural block presents many serious risks for the woman. Are 
					there risks for her baby? Since it is unlikely any woman would choose 
					a form of pain relief that puts her baby at risk, women are not told 
					that in 8 percent to 12 percent of labors in which the woman is given 
					epidural block, severe fetal hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the unborn 
					baby) is shown on the electronic fetal monitor. The American College 
					of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, after acknowledging the frequency 
					at which birthing babies suffer hypoxia after the woman is given an 
					epidural block, recommends that all women given epidural block have 
					continuous electronic fetal monitoring so that fetal hypoxia can be 
					identified.
                </p>
                <p>
					Does this lack of oxygen have any permanent effect on the baby? 
					Research has found that 1-month-old babies whose mothers were given 
					epidural block during labor may have neurological test results that 
					suggest possible minor brain damage. While this is a finding not yet 
					completely confirmed scientifically, it is a possibility that is 
					certainly worrisome and should be told to women offered epidural 
					block. Epidural block carries another risk that is found in many 
					of the interventions and technologies used during birth: the "cascade 
					effect." This means that the use of one intervention leads to the use 
					of another intervention, and the use of that intervention leads to 
					the use of yet another intervention, and so on. If, for example, a 
					woman is given a drug to start labor or to make labor proceed faster, 
					this leads to more painful contractions. This in turn leads to the 
					offer of pain relief, usually with epidural block, which, as we have 
					seen, leads to an increased use of forceps or vacuum extraction, which 
					leads to episiotomy or to cesarean section, which leads to fever in 
					the mother, which leads to tests and treatments for the baby.
                </p>
                <p>
					There are other cascades of interventions during labor. For example, 
					routine electronic fetal monitoring leads to more cesarean sections, 
					which lead to babies with respiratory distress syndrome or prematurity, 
					which leads to putting these babies into newborn intensive care units. 
					Every one of these interventions carries risks for mother and baby! It 
					is easy to see how the high-tech approach to birth actually creates 
					many new problems. Rather than change their habits, however, doctors 
					conclude that birth is quite risky, when in reality doctors have 
					caused it to be risky. This is one important reason why homebirths, 
					freestanding birth center births and having your own midwife as the 
					primary maternity caregiver are all associated with fewer risky 
					interventions and, therefore, safer care.
                </p>
                <p>
					No honest doctor would ever suggest that drugs given for pain are 
					without risks. But in their pursuit of relieving a laboring mother's 
					pain, doctors inevitably resort to prescribing drugs, when in fact, 
					there are many non-pharmacological ways to relieve pain. For example, 
					scientific research has proven a number of drug-free techniques to be 
					effective in relieving the pain of normal labor, including: the 
					continuous presence during labor of a midwife, a doula or a loved 
					one; sitting in a tub of warm water or standing in a shower; freedom 
					to move about and assume any position; massage; acupuncture; 
					reflexology. None of these techniques involves any risk to the 
					woman or her baby, and they are often promoted by midwives, but 
					rarely promoted by doctors.
                </p>
                <p>
					Other harmful technologies aside from those already mentioned are 
					frequently used during birth, such as the use of drugs to start or 
					speed up labor, forceps or vacuum extraction, and cutting of genitals 
					(episiotomy); but space does not permit a review of all of them. In my 
					book you will find information on how to get the most reliable data on 
					specific technologies likely to be used during pregnancy and birth.
                </p>
                <h2>
					Why the Unnecessary Use of Technology?
                </h2>
                <p>
					To understand why so much unnecessary technology is used during 
					pregnancy and birth, it is necessary to understand how technology 
					comes to be used. We must first ask, Is the use of a new technology 
					preceded by careful scientific evaluation, then followed by official 
					approval for use and requirements for education of doctors in its use? 
					Sadly, the truth lies in another direction. An example of a recent 
					birth technology now rapidly spreading in the United States will 
					illustrate the reality.
                </p>
                <p>
					Several years ago a drug with the generic name misoprostol (called 
					Cytotec by the drug company that manufactures it) was approved by the 
					Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a prescription drug to be used 
					for certain ailments of the stomach. It is known that one of its side 
					effects is severe cramps or contractions of the uterus, and for this 
					reason the label says it should never be used on pregnant women. 
					Obstetricians, however, discovered that given orally or vaginally, 
					Cytotec, because of its side effect of violent uterine cramping, can 
					induce (start) or accelerate labor.
                </p>
                <p>
					So without any prior testing of Cytotec for labor induction, 
					obstetricians began to use it on their birthing women. Doctors on the 
					Internet began to describe their experience with this new way of 
					inducing labor. One doctor wrote, "I must say I have heard some great 
					things about Cytotec myself. Just be careful. The stuff turns the 
					cervix to complete mushie." A few studies have appeared in obstetric 
					journals, but all the studies are too small to give adequate 
					scientific evidence about this use of the drug. These studies did show 
					some risks, such as a tendency for the fetus's heart to start racing, 
					as well as other signs of fetal distress, and the explosion or rupture 
					of the uterus in a few women. A review of the scientific evidence by a 
					highly prestigious scientific body says that because of the lack of 
					sufficient scientific evaluation and the reports of serious side 
					effects, the use of Cytotec for labor induction "cannot be recommended 
					for routine use at this stage."
                </p>
                <p>
					The fact that Cytotec is not approved by the FDA for labor induction, 
					is not approved for this use by the drug manufacturer (who still 
					states on the label that it is not to be given to pregnant women), 
					is not endorsed by either the American College of Obstetricians and 
					Gynecologists or midwifery organizations, and is not approved by 
					scientists for routine use has had no apparent effect on the 
					enthusiasm with which doctors are starting to use it. And there is 
					nothing to stop doctors from using Cytotec for this "off label" 
					purpose, because although the FDA must approve a drug before it goes 
					on the market, once it is on the market for a specified purpose, any 
					doctor can use it in any dose for any purpose on any patient.
                </p>
                <p>
					After one obstetrician in South Dakota proudly told me over lunch that 
					he was the first doctor in his community to use Cytotec for labor 
					induction and now urges other doctors to use it, he justified his 
					actions: "We will wait forever for the bureaucrats at the FDA in 
					Washington, D.C., to approve drugs, so we must try them out ourselves 
					if we want progress." When asked, he admitted he doesn't tell the 
					women to whom he is giving Cytotec that the drug is not approved for 
					this purpose, nor does he ask for informed consent. He scoffed at my 
					suggestion that he is experimenting on women without their knowledge, 
					much less their consent. The Oregon State Health Department told me 
					their records show Cytotec to be the most common way of inducing labor 
					in that state, and it is used on thousands of laboring women.
                </p>
                <p>
					The use of Cytotec on birthing women has spread like wildfire for a 
					very simple reason, told to me by many doctors: its use brings back 
					the possibility of "daylight obstetrics", that is, women brought to 
					the hospital first thing in the morning and induced with Cytotec will 
					give birth by late afternoon and the doctor can be home for dinner. 
					How many women will have their uterus ruptured before a court case 
					finally applies the brakes to this practice? I personally welcome 
					learning of cases where Cytotec induction was used without fully 
					informed consent and there was subsequent uterine rupture, cervical 
					laceration or other serious complications.
                </p>
                <p>
					The unsystematic, untested way in which Cytotec for labor induction 
					was introduced and disseminated is typical for the technologies used 
					during pregnancy and birth. Ultrasound scanning during pregnancy and 
					electronic fetal monitoring during labor are further examples of 
					uncontrolled introduction and dissemination of untested technologies. 
					There is a big gap between what we know to be the best scientific 
					maternity care practices and what is actually practiced. As a result, 
					there is no consumer protection except litigation. Doctors blame 
					lawyers and women for the fact that more than 70 percent of American 
					obstetricians have been sued one or more times, but litigation is 
					the only way a woman and her family can protect themselves against 
					malpractice.
                </p>
                <p>
					Many of the motivations behind the use of technologies by doctors 
					are non-medical. Several examples, all supported by scientific study, 
					will illustrate this fact. Studies of birth certificates show that 
					birth is more common Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The 
					only explanation that can be given is that doctors and hospitals 
					use the induction of labor for their own convenience. More shocking 
					is data that show emergency cesarean section to occur most commonly 
					on weekdays during the daytime. Deciding to declare a labor an 
					emergency situation requiring emergency surgery is influenced by 
					the convenience of the staff.
                </p>
                <p>
					Another non-medical factor that motivates the use of technology is 
					money. Data from several states in the United States show cesarean 
					section to be least common among women on Medicaid and most common 
					among private patients in private hospitals. One would think the 
					opposite, assuming that poor women have poor health and need more 
					interventions. But doctors and hospitals make bigger profits if 
					technology is used in cases where the patients or their insurance 
					can afford to pay. Commercial interests also play a role. Manufacturers 
					of drugs and technologies have a variety of ways to influence doctors 
					to use their drugs and machines, including bestowing a wide range 
					of gifts and perks.
                </p>
                <p>
					Doctors' fear of litigation is another non-medical motivation for 
					using technology. Doctors are afraid both of having to go to court 
					and of having to pay higher malpractice insurance premiums. Two prime 
					examples of the unnecessary use of technology due to doctors' fear of 
					litigation are routine electronic fetal monitoring during normal labor 
					and cesarean section with little or no medical justification. A 
					fundamental principle of medical practice is that whatever the doctor 
					does must be, first and foremost, for the benefit of the patient, 
					not the benefit of the doctor. But picking up a scalpel and cutting 
					open a woman's body for a cesarean section because of fear of going 
					to court or paying high insurance premiums is not the practice of 
					medicine but the practice of fear and greed.
                </p>
                <p>
					Many obstetricians have an unfortunate tendency to promise women a 
					perfect baby if the women will make use of the doctor's expertise 
					and the hospital's technology. But if you play God, you will be 
					blamed for any natural disasters that ensue. A family with a dead 
					or damaged baby or mother does not sue because some lawyer talks 
					them into it, but because they feel deceived and are stonewalled 
					by doctors and hospitals when trying to get full information on 
					what happened. If you don't believe you will be stonewalled while 
					trying to get information on what happened at a birth, try to get 
					information on the 350 to 1,000 women who die every year in the 
					United States around the time of birth (maternal mortality). 
					Although individual states have regulations that require such 
					deaths to be reported, no one, including you, me or scientists 
					wanting to study why these women die, can get access to information 
					on these maternal deaths. We do know that at least half these deaths 
					are not reported, that black women have a four times greater risk of 
					maternal death, that nearly all these women die in the hospital 
					rather than at home, and that with adequate medical attention many, 
					if not most, of these women need not have died. That last fact is 
					why the doctors' fear of litigation builds the stone wall.
                </p>
                <p>
					Another reason for the overuse of technology is the mistaken belief 
					by many doctors that technology is science and the use of technology 
					is the practice of scientific medicine. They confuse technological 
					advances with progress. Scientific medicine is practice based on the 
					best scientific evidence, not practice that uses technology. 
					Practicing doctors are not scientists. Scientists must believe they 
					don't know, while practicing doctors must believe they do know.
                </p>
                <p>
					In other highly industrialized countries where midwives far outnumber 
					obstetricians, the midwifery approach brings both an essential 
					counterbalance to the high tech approach of obstetricians and a brake 
					to unnecessary technology. For example, while the United States has 
					35,000 obstetricians and about 5,000 midwives, Great Britain has 
					32,000 midwives and less than 1,000 obstetricians. The midwives 
					promote the far greater use of less invasive, less risky, low-tech 
					approaches. In America no such counterbalance exists because 
					organized obstetrics fights to keep midwives under their absolute 
					control. So we find far higher rates of high-tech, unnecessary use 
					of technology in U.S. maternity care than, for example, any country 
					in Western Europe, even though the United States loses far more 
					babies and women around the time of birth. Because of its 
					obstetric-intensive maternity care, the United States spends twice 
					as much per capita on maternity care than any of the other countries 
					with lower mortality rates for women and babies around the time of 
					birth. The financial waste of scientifically unfounded high tech 
					obstetric maternity care in the United States is enormous. By 
					changing to a far more modern, more scientifically based maternity 
					care with 75 percent of the births attended by midwives, the 
					elimination of routine electronic fetal monitoring and a cesarean 
					section rate in compliance with the recommendations of the federal 
					government, the United States could save $13 billion to $20 billion 
					a year. As a taxpayer and consumer of maternity care, you need to 
					be aware of this waste.
                </p>
                <p>
					We see there are many reasons for the unnecessary overuse of 
					technology during pregnancy and birth, most reasons connected to 
					doctors. As a practicing physician for more than years, I have had 
					long experience within the profession and can bring an important 
					point of view to your understanding of doctors. We doctors are not 
					evil people. Most doctors are hard working, caring professionals 
					doing the best they know how to do. But it is essential to remember 
					two fundamental facts about doctors. First, we doctors operate 
					within a system that strongly influences what we do. Today's 
					obstetricians are not the ones who decided a century ago to do 
					away with midwifery in America. Almost without exception, they buy 
					into the present system that insists obstetricians are the preferred 
					providers of primary maternity care, even in the face of scientific 
					data to the contrary.
                </p>
                <p>
					The second fact about doctors is that they are human in every 
					respect, not gods, and should not be put on a pedestal. If it is 
					OK to bash your automobile mechanic who has done a bad job, then 
					it is equally OK to bash a doctor you suspect of malpractice. 
					Doctors should be as accountable to the public as any other group 
					that serves the public. And to understand why doctors do what they 
					do, you must accept their humanness and vulnerability to 
					inappropriate influences. In 1992 the average take-home income of 
					U.S. obstetricians was $250,000 a year, and today it is even higher. 
					The present scientifically unjustified monopoly of maternity care by 
					obstetricians in the United States is richly rewarding the 
					obstetricians, and you can be sure they will fight to maintain 
					the status quo, keeping out any competition such as midwives and 
					out-of-hospital birth. This is why, as a consumer of maternity care, 
					you must beware what you are told by doctors and hospitals and take 
					full responsibility for ensuring you get the kind of pregnancy and 
					birth experience best suited to your needs and no one else's.
                </p>

					What You Can Do
                </h2>
                <p>
					How do you get the maternity care best suited to you and your family 
					with the appropriate use of technology? You can take the following 
					steps:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Choose the right primary maternity care provider. Talk to 
							the midwives and doctors available to you. Ask lots of 
							questions before deciding whom to use. Get data on their 
							practices. If they resist giving you the data, watch out. 
							Examine their faces closely as you tell them you want a 
							birth that is empowering. Are they patronizing and 
							condescending in their approach and resentful of your 
							questions, or do they encourage you to take responsibility 
							for your own pregnancy and birth? Don't be afraid to change 
							providers if after a few visits you don't like how they are 
							caring (or not caring) for you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Choose the right place to give birth. Some women need to 
							give birth at home. Remember, this is a perfectly safe choice 
							for most of you. If someone says it is not safe for you, get 
							a second opinion. Other women prefer a free standing birth 
							center staffed by midwives. Remember, this also is a 
							perfectly safe choice for most of you. Yet other women will 
							feel better in a hospital. That's OK too as long as you see 
							to it that you get as much choice as possible in what will 
							happen to you in the hospital. Whether the hospital has 
							midwives on its staff or welcomes midwives coming in with 
							birthing women tells you a lot about that hospital. Visit 
							the hospitals or birth centers and ask lots of questions 
							about their practices, remembering the important thing is 
							not the interior decorating but your freedom and control. 
							Don't let anyone scare you into a choice not truly your own.
						</li>
						<li>
							Choose the kind of birth you want. Make a birth plan. Find 
							other birth plans to get ideas. Find out what kinds of 
							options are available. Do you want the first part of your 
							labor to happen at home (a proven way to reduce the use of 
							unnecessary interventions) and if so, how will you be 
							monitored before going to the birth center or hospital? 
							Whom do you want and not want to be there with you during 
							your labor and birth? Decide what interventions you will or 
							will not accept and put this in your plan. For example, make 
							sure you do not get pubic shaving or enema during labor, both 
							humiliating and both unnecessary. Find out which pain relief 
							you want after you get all the information on the pros and 
							cons of the various drug and non-drug possibilities. Under 
							which circumstances will you accept or not accept: being 
							given drugs to start or accelerate labor, having your 
							genitals cut (episiotomy), having your baby taken from you 
							after birth? Use scientific evidence as the basis for your 
							decisions, not what doctors and hospitals call "community 
							standards," which means "this is how we all do it here", a 
							dangerous approach to practice based on the principle that if 
							everyone does it, it's OK for me to do it. Say "show me the 
							data" again and again. Read up, using a critical eye. Protect 
							yourself and your baby by rejecting out of hand any 
							suggestion that you should put blind faith in what you are 
							told or read.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ensure that your wishes are carried out. Document your wishes 
							in a written birth plan. Give a copy of your birth plan to 
							your caregivers and to the birth center or hospital well 
							before your expected due date, assuring them they will be 
							held accountable for following the plan and your wishes. If 
							your plan elicits any kind of negative reaction, you have 
							the wrong caregiver and/or wrong hospital. Bring the plan 
							with you to the hospital at the time of birth. Doctors and 
							hospitals are not used to having anyone tell them what they 
							can and can't do, most especially patients. For this reason, 
							it is essential that you have a support person with you in 
							the hospital: your partner, your midwife, another family 
							member, a friend, a doula. This support person must be ready 
							and able to advocate strongly in your interest, especially 
							when all your energy is consumed by labor and birth. Your 
							support person must be familiar with your plan and exactly 
							what it specifies and why. You and your support person must 
							know what your rights are while you are in the hospital and 
							effective ways to deal with hospital staff. A homebirth 
							midwife I know who sometimes accompanies a client to the 
							hospital when a transfer is required, takes two things with 
							her to the hospital: a book that summarizes the scientific 
							evidence on interventions used during birth so that if 
							hospital staff object to what she suggests, she can whip out 
							the book and show the data; and a door stop so that no one 
							can come into the room where her client is laboring unless 
							she and the woman give permission. This is bringing some 
							degree of patient control into the hospital.
						</li>
						<li>
							Document what happens. The small, hand-held video camera is a 
							powerful instrument with which to document just what happened 
							during your birth. Be sure to film any encounters with 
							hospital staff. It is a wonderful way to both remember the 
							experience and make a record for future purposes if 
							necessary. Believe it or not, some hospitals now forbid 
							using video cameras during the labor or birth. This is scary, 
							suggesting they are more concerned with their own protection 
							from malpractice than in your own memories of this family 
							event. It also suggests they have something to hide. If your 
							birth results in difficulties or a bad outcome either for the 
							woman or the baby, then once again you must accept 
							responsibility for finding out what happened. Demand 
							information from caregivers and the hospital, tape recording 
							each encounter. Fortunately you now have the right to a copy 
							of all your medical records. Get them. Find someone who can 
							help you interpret them. If you do not get satisfaction with 
							your inquiry, go to the local health authorities with your 
							tape recorder. If you still are stonewalled, sadly you may 
							have no recourse but to sue. We live in a litigious society 
							because the courts are the only place it is possible for 
							individuals to get answers from the powerful in our society, 
							be they large corporations, hospitals or powerful 
							professional groups such as doctors. Never forget you have 
							the basic right to freedom of choice and freedom of 
							information about one of the most important events in your 
							life and the life of your family - the birth of your baby.
