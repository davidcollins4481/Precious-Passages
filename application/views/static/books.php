							<u>The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth</u>  
							By: Henci Goer
						</dt>
						<dd>
							For any couple determined to have an intervention free, 
							medication free birth, this is the book for you.  While you 
							may not end up with your ideal situation, this book will enable 
							you to make informed, educated decisions.  This book is also a 
							good read for couples planning a home birth.

							<u>Pregnancy Childbirth and the Newborn</u>
							By: Simkin, Whalley and Keppler
						</dt>
						<dd>
							This is a very complete book full of easy to understand 
							information.  Penny Simkin is world renowned for her childbirth 
							education and sibling preparation classes.  Along those lines, 
							an especially interesting chapter is "Preparing Other Children 
							for Birth and the Baby".  If you purchase this book, make sure 
							to get the 1991 or later printing, the information is much 
							more relevant to modern lifestyle.

							<u>The Expectant Father</u>   
							By: Armin Brott
						</dt>
						<dd>
							This slightly comical take on pregnancy and fatherhood was 
							written by a father for a father.  Mr. Brott's book is an 
							accurate account of what to expect from your wife and new 
							baby.  By the way, this review came from my husband who read 
							this book during our first pregnancy.

							<u>Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way</u>  
							By: Susan McCutcheon
						</dt>
						<dd>
							One of the best Bradley textbooks available today.  Even if 
							you don't plan to use the Bradley Method for your childbirth 
							education, this book is worth reading for its information on 
							nutrition and deep relaxation.  There is a protein counter in 
							the back that is a very useful reference to track you daily 
							protein intake.  I especially like the Bradley Method because 
							it gets the partner very involved in labor support.

							<u>Supernatural Childbirth</u>  
							By: Jackie Mize
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Is painless childbirth possible?  This author says yes.  
							<u>Supernatural Childbirth</u> is Jackie Mize's personal 
							account of how she used her faith to achieve a fearless 
							pregnancy and a painless birth.
						</dd>

							<u>The Pregnancy Book</u>  
							By: Sears and Sears
						</dt>
						<dd>
							An overall great reference for the changes that occur in 
							both the mother and the baby during pregnancy.  Easy to read 
							with excellent graphics.

							<u>The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers</u>
							By: Newman and Pitman
						</dt>
						<dd>
							I am a huge proponent of breastfeeding for reasons too 
							numerous to list here.  This book will be indispensable to 
							you if you are even thinking about breastfeeding.  Dr. Newman 
							explains the origins of the most common problems and offers 
							practical, easy to implement solutions.  You should make it 
							a point to read this book BEFORE you have your baby.
