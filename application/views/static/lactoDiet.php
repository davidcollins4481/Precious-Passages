                    This program is designed for you if you are 
                    expecting one baby and you have no significant additional protein/calorie 
                    requirements, based on your responses to the Brewer Pregnancy Nutrition 
                    Profile.

                <p>
                    Pregnancy makes the same nutritional demands of vegetarian prospective 
                    mothers as it does of non-vegetarians. The only difference is that the 
                    vegetarian mother meets her needs a different way.  If you are a 
                    vegetarian, you will probably have to be even more conscientious about 
                    your daily food choices than someone who eats meat. If you are a strict 
                    vegetarian who uses no animal products (no milk, cheese, butter, eggs or 
                    meat), your diet must be very carefully managed to ensure that you obtain 
                    from other sources everything that those foods commonly contribute to the 
                    standard diet, including calories. Happily, these requirements pose no 
                    great problem for most vegetarians once they learn about them.  Most 
                    vegetarians are already thoughtful, concerned, and dedicated to excellent 
                    nutrition. That's why they become vegetarians in the first place!

                    Piecing together all the groups into a nutritionally sound and 
                    appetizing menu on the lacto-ovo diet is like doing a puzzle, 
                    only in this instance the pieces can fit together in many different 
                    ways and still come out right. Once you master he knack of combining 
                    proteins and figuring partial exchanges, the enormous range of fine 
                    vegetarian cuisine is yours to explore.

                    each soy milk or other low-fat milk, yogurt or cottage cheese exchange 
                    you choose, add two extra exchanges from Group 7 (fats and oils). In 
                    addition, for each soy exchange, select two from Group 2 (Calcium 
                    Replacements). For every three soy exchanges, add one extra selection 
                    from Group 9 (Vitamin A foods).

                    There are other foods that contain a considerable amount of calcium,

                    One exchange provides six grams of protein, and vitamins and minerals 
                    in abundance, including one milligram of well-assimilated iron and 600 
                    units of vitamin A, the anti-infection vitamin. Added together, the milk 
                    and egg exchanges provide a baseline of 44 grams of protein and a 
                    vitamin, mineral and calorie foundation for the rest of the diet.

                    One exchange provides 7 grams of protein. The plant sources of protein, 
                    however, are incomplete.  That is, each is deficient in one or more of 
                    the essential amino acids needed to form the pattern of amino acids 
                    distribution that is best used by the human body. There are two ways to 
                    fill in the pattern for plant proteins: (a) eat a small amount of animal 
                    protein along with the plant protein, or, (b) combine plant proteins so 
                    that they complement each other (that is, combine plant sources that are 
                    low in some of the protein building blocks, called amino acids, with 
                    other plant sources that are high in those amino acids). In some cases, 
                    complementary plant proteins mixed in the proper ratios surpass the 
                    protein utilization rate of animal proteins. In vegetarian meal 
                    planning, serve legumes with grains or combine them in dishes such as 
                    Spanish rice, barley and bean stew, or pasta with beans. Round out your 
                    amino acid pattern with a selection from vegetables and one from nuts 
                    and seeds. See the Brewer Pregnancy Vegetarian Diet #2 for specific 
                    ratios, and consult a vegetarian cookbook such as Laurel's Kitchen 
                    (New York: Bantam, 1978) that has extensive nutrition tables and 
                    discusses protein combining in detail. Note: If you select eggs or 
                    dairy products to fulfill some of these protein exchanges, you may not 
                    count them twice (as satisfactions of Group 1 and 3 requirements). You 
                    must have additional servings of eggs and dairy for this group's 
                    requirements. This principle also applies to the beans, grains, 
                    vegetables, nuts and seeds, some of which appear in other places on 
                    the diet. To meet your protein and calorie needs, you must have 
                    additional servings, above and beyond what you choose for other 
                    categories.

                    These vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals such as A and the B 
                    complex, which is necessary to aid your body in making use of the 
                    protein provided by other foods. This group also contains food fiber to 
                    promote normal digestion and bowel movements -- significant during 
                    pregnancy when constipation can sometimes be a problem.

                    These foods are prime sources of the carbohydrates you need to fuel your 
                    body. If you have too few carbohydrates, your body burns the protein you 
                    eat for energy, thus robbing you and your baby of the building blocks 
                    for tissue growth and repair. Carbohydrates from whole grains and starch 
                    vegetables affect you differently than the simple sugars found in candy, 
                    honey, jams, soft drinks, bakery goods, and refined sugar itself. The 
                    complex carbohydrates are also sources of B vitamins.

                    Vitamin C is important for the body's manufacture of collagen, the 
                    connective substance that holds tissues together. Without adequate C, 
                    your uterus is less strong and may not perform well in labor. Vitamin C 
                    is also crucial in the body's defense system against infection, and in 
                    improving iron absorption. As a vegetarian, you need more C than other 
                    pregnant women because the high fiber content of your diet tends to 
                    impair iron absorption. Vitamin C assists in iron absorption. Try to 
                    eat the Vitamin C exchanges along with your soy exchanges since the soy 
                    products are your major sources of iron.

                    Vitamin A is important in preventing infection. During pregnancy, when 
                    the pressure of the growing uterus on the bladder is constant, extra 
                    vitamin A helps protect you against bladder and kidney infections. 
                    During breastfeeding, it helps keep you free from breast infections. 
                    Each exchange is approximately 7,000 I.U. You need an extra exchange 
                    every day to make up for the liver exchange you are skipping.

                    Salt your food to taste. Cutting back on salt can cause a fall in the 
                    amount of blood circulating through your placenta, thus reducing the 
                    supply of nutrients passing to your baby. Too little salt in the diet 
                    leads to leg cramps as well, since all the muscles of your body require 
                    sodium for efficient functioning. If you have been avoiding salt, add a 
                    little bit back to your diet at a time to acclimate your taste buds 
                    once again. It is essential to have enough sodium in your diet to 
                    support the expansion of your blood volume throughout your pregnancy.

                    Drink to quench thirst, but do not force fluids. Fruits, vegetables, 
                    and juices all contain a goodly proportion of water plus additional 
                    nutrients. Forcing water may fill you up without giving you much 
                    nutrition - a hazard in late pregnancy, when you have to make every 
                    bite count and you have less and less space in which to put the food. 
                    Diet beverages, coffee, teas, and imitation fruit drinks should be 
                    avoided for the same reason. If you are thirsty drink water or 
                    something nutritious (real juice or a milk beverage) or an occasional 
                    tea.  Note: If your drinking water is from a well, you may wish to have 
                    it tested by your health department before drinking it during pregnancy 
                    to make sure it does not contain contaminants such as MTBE, PCBs, 
                    and/or organisms such as giardia that can cause chronic intestinal 
                    upsets. Reports from the EPA published in 1999 and 2000 on water 
                    quality in the United States indicate that more than a third of all 
                    wells in the U.S. (some of them supplies for municipal water systems) 
                    contain higher than permissible amounts of these contaminants. Based on 
                    the results of your testing, you may wish to filter and/ or treat your 
                    drinking water.

                    These supplements are required on the vegetarian diet because the 
                    higher fiber content and the lack of meat protein content combine to 
                    interfere with iron availability. Eating soybeans and foods with 
                    vitamin C and calcium (see Groups 2 and 7) also increases iron 
                    absorption. The tablespoon of oil provides extra vitamin E and 
                    essential linoleic acid.
