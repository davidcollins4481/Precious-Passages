                    Induction of labor is offered when the physician feels the baby is 
                    safer outside your womb or when the mother asks for one.  The decision 
                    to allow a doctor to induce labor is very important.  Induction often 
                    leads to other interventions and ultimately a Cesarean section if the 
                    procedure fails.  While there are valid medical reasons for induction, 
                    in order to give your informed consent, it is vital that you learn as 
                    much as possible about the procedure itself as well as your doctor's 
                    reason for wanting to induce.  Simply being past your due date, in my 
                    opinion, is a very poor reason to induce.
