                    A woman's environment, body, and mind all contribute to her perception of 
                    pain and decisions about medication in childbirth. You can use this list to 
                    expand your options in several ways. Try a new suggestion from each 
                    category in your practice sessions. Check it before discussing options with 
                    your birth attendant. Pack your bag with it in mind. Hang it on the door of 
                    your birthing room for ideas in labor. Share it with your coach and doctor 
                    or midwife and ask for support in trying all the options available.
