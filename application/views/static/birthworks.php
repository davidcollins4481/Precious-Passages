                    Birth Works&reg; embodies the philosophy of developing a woman's self 
                    confidence, trust and faith in her ability to give birth. It is our goal 
                    to promote safe and loving birth experiences through education, 
                    introspection and confident action.

					FAQs about Birth Works&reg;
					<dl>
						<dt>
							1. What is special about BirthWorks&reg;?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The BW classes are designed to help women have more trust and 
							faith in their innate ability to give birth and to help build 
							self-confidence. Our unique approach promotes learning in an 
							emotional context so that it is more meaningful and lasting. We 
							do not teach breathing patterns but instead encourage slow deep 
							breathing and working with the contractions. Although parents 
							can start anytime during their pregnancy, we encourage expectant 
							parents to take classes before they are pregnant or in the first 
							trimester.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							2. Who takes Birth Works&reg; classes?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Birth Works&reg; is for all expectant parents regardless of their 
							birthing history. Women with previous cesareans or vaginal births 
							and new parents share beliefs, choices and experiences together in 
							the same setting. They learn there is no one right way to give 
							birth. Our highest goal is to help build self-confidence so each 
							woman can feel positive about her birth regardless of the outcome.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							3. When should I take Birth Works&reg;?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							As early in pregnancy as possible because that is the time to be 
							learning about belief systems, interviewing doctors and 
							determining your place of birth and birth plan. However, it is 
							never too late to contact a Birth Works&reg; instructor in your 
							area.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							4. How long is a Birth Works&reg; series of classes?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Classes are traditionally 10 weeks for 2½ hours each class. 
							Some of our instructors offer private, individualized sessions.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							5. You say that Birth Works&reg; is not a method. Then what is it?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Birth Works&reg; is a process that helps to develop a woman's 
							confidence in her own ability to give birth. We do not believe 
							there is any one right way or method to give birth for each birth 
							is unique unto itself and each woman needs to give birth in her 
							own way, and be guided by her own body knowledge which already 
							knows how to give birth.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							6. Do you teach breathing patterns?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Though some people say breathing patterns helped them in labor, 
							most others feel they don't work. In Birth Works&reg;, we do not 
							teach breathing patterns for thinking about patterns stimulates 
							the cortical or thinking brain and this inhibits the progress of 
							labor. Instead, we encourage slow deep breathing, working with 
							each contraction.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							7. One of the differences I notice in your program is that you 
							teach pelvic bodywork. What is it?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Pelvic bodywork is an experiential technique which increases a 
							person's awareness of how their own pelvis moves and opens in 
							different labor positions. It reinforces the concept that a 
							woman's body is designed for birth.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							8. I hear that Birth Works&reg; provides both an emotional and 
							physical preparation for birth. Please explain.
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The course is designed so that information is presented in an 
							emotional context for that deepens the impact of learning. In 
							other words, people in the classes are more likely to remember 
							something they have experienced rather than something learned in 
							a lecture format. We also explore feelings and emotions so people 
							can become more aware of beliefs they have about birth and work to 
							change ones as needed.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							9. How is the Birth Works ® childbirth preparation program different 
							from other methods?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Birth Works&reg; is a process...not a method. We believe that each 
							birth is unique and that there is no one right way to give birth. 
							We believe all women already know how to give birth and help them 
							to discover their own best way.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							10. Why do you include women with all birthing histories (new 
							parents, women with previous vaginal and cesarean births), 
							including VBAC in the same class?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							In Birth Works&reg; we believe the information and experiential 
							techniques are applicable to any women giving birth regardless of 
							if she is a new parent or having more children. What better way is 
							there to learn about birth than through the sharing of stories 
							that comes from women with a variety of experiences?
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							11. A Birth Works&reg; class series is 10 weeks long with each 
							class lasting 2½ hours What happens if I miss some weeks?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The Birth Works&reg; classes were carefully designed so that each 
							class is like the piece of a puzzle that comes together for 
							completion at the end. Participants may wish to check with their 
							instructor to make up missed classes.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							12. Where can I take a Birth Works&reg; class?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Classes are offered around the country. Call/write/e-mail the 
							main office for referrals to instructors in your community.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							13. Who are Birth Works&reg; instructors?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Birth Works&reg; CCE's are women who have completed a thorough 
							and comprehensive certification program and who share a commitment 
							to educate and empower birthing women.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							14. Will my insurance company reimburse for Birth Works&reg; 
							instruction?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Some insurance companies do. Our instructors will provide 
							necessary receipts and certificates.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							15. Do Birth Works&reg; instructors attend births?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							It is common for instructors to be asked to attend births. 
							Check with your instructor regarding her availability and labor 
							doula practice. You can also contact the Birth Works&reg; Doula 
							Program at the main office for referrals to doulas in your area.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							16. I don't want natural childbirth. Iis Birth Works&reg; for me?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Birth Works&reg; instructors respect the right of every woman to 
							make her own choices regarding her pregnancy and birth. Because 
							Birth Works&reg; believes that birth is not a medical event, we 
							work from a philosophy that includes the emotional, psychological 
							and spiritual needs of birthing women. The Birth Works&reg; 
							education process enables women to take responsibility for their 
							births and make informed choices.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							17. Who can I bring with me to classes?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Pregnant women and their partners attend Birth Works&reg; classes.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							18. In Birth Works&reg;, expectant parents are asked to take your 
							classes within the first trimester or even before they are 
							pregnant. If I do this, will I forget what I learned by the time 
							I give birth?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							An essential part of the birth preparation is becoming aware of 
							beliefs you may have about birth, beliefs that will influence all 
							your decision making from choosing a birthplace and birth team, to 
							how you plan to give birth. In addition, learning how to 
							effectively communicate with your caregiver, and learning 
							important information about nutrition are examples of why it is 
							better to begin classes early and not wait until the 7th month of 
							pregnancy. By the 7th month when many other programs begin their 
							classes, wouldn't it be nice to know you are happy with your 
							caregiver, place of birth and birth team? Then you can rest and 
							enjoy the end of your pregnancy, and get ready for the baby to 
							come. This information begins to be processed during Birth Works&reg; 
							classes and won't be forgotten - rather it will enhance your birth 
							experience.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							19. Birth Works&reg; is a new program. How did it start?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Cathy Daub, Physical Therapist, designed and taught the first 
							Birth Works&reg; classes in New Jersey in 1981. The course was 
							then developed into a teacher certification program at which time 
							the manual was developed. It became a completed program in 1988. 
							The goal of Birth Works&reg; is to help women have more positive 
							birth experiences by learning to have more faith and trust in 
							their own body knowledge that already knows how to give birth. 
							The classes are for any woman with any birth experience who plans 
							to give birth at home, in the hospital or in a birthing center.
						</dd>
						<br/>
						<dt>
							20. Is Birth Works&reg; a program with full credentials?
						</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes. Birth Works&reg; is a national/international childbirth 
							education program, with full accreditation. It is fully 
							incorporated with an impressive Board of Advisors including Michel 
							Odent MD, Bethany Hayes MD, Robbie Davis-Floyd PhD 
							(anthropologist), Jan Tritten (editor of Midwifery Today magazine), 
							Marshal Klaus MD, Marsden Wagner MD, Doris Haire 
							(author / activist), J Kaufman (Polymorph Films), Ina May Gaskin 
							(midwife), Lewis Mehl Madrona MD, Henci Goer (author / educator),

							educator), and Ray DeVries (sociologist). When a trainee 
							successfully completes the Birth Works&reg; program she is a CCE
