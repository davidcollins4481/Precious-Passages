					Choose your sports carefully during pregnancy. Some activities put 
					you at greater risk for injury than others. The American College of 
					Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends the following during 
					pregnancy: 
                </p>
                <p>
					Sports to enjoy
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_great-pregnancy-exercise-walking_7863.bc" target="_blank">
								 Brisk walking
							</a>,
							about a 12- to 15-minute mile, is great before, during, and 
							after pregnancy. If you're new to exercise, it's a good 
							starting point. As you become more fit you'll probably want 
							to pick up the pace.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_great-pregnancy-exercise-swimming_7822.bc" target="_blank">
								Swimming
							</a>
							is excellent because it uses both large muscle groups (arms 
							and legs), it works your heart, without straining your 
							ligaments and joints, tones your body, and the water supports 
							your weight. You shouldn't dive during the last two trimesters 
							because your center of gravity has shifted, increasing your 
							risk of slipping. You also want to avoid having your abdomen 
							hitting the water too hard.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_running-during-pregnancy_7877.bc" target="_blank">
								Jogging
							</a>
							is fine in moderation only if you did it before you became 
							pregnant. Since there's a greater risk of falling down, 
							however, you should do it cautiously. Avoid becoming overheated, 
							and drink plenty of water to replace what you lose through 
							sweating.
						</li>
						<li>
							A moderately paced game of tennis is acceptable if you played 
							tennis before you became pregnant. You may have problems with 
							balance and sudden stops, so watch your step. Most women find 
							that it's hard to keep up their game as their bellies get 
							bigger in the second and third trimesters.
						</li>
						<li>
							Golf and bowling are fine as recreation, but they don't really 
							condition the heart. Again, keeping your balance during the 
							later months of pregnancy may pose a problem.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_great-pregnancy-exercise-low-impact-aerobics_7879.bc" target="_blank">
						Low-impact or water aerobics
					</a>,
					<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_great-pregnancy-exercise-prenatal-yoga_7862.bc" target="_blank">
						yoga
					</a>, 
					and stretching while not sports per se are other great ways to stay 
					in shape during pregnancy.
                </p>
                <p>
					Sports to avoid
					<ul>
						<li>
							Downhill skiing. ACOG advises against downhill skiing at 
							any time during pregnancy because of the danger of serious 
							injuries and hard falls. However, some obstetricians say it 
							may be okay if you're an experienced skiier. If you do choose 
							to ski, stick to gentle slopes and be aware that you may have 
							problems with balance as your belly expands. A safer choice is 
							cross-country skiing, which is also much better for building 
							cardiovascular fitness. Also, try to avoid skiing at very high 
							altitudes — above 10,000 feet — because there's less oxygen 
							available to you and your baby at that height.
						</li>
						<li>
							Horseback riding.  Unless you've been riding for some time, 
							it's not worth the risk to start riding during pregnancy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Contact sports such as soccer, basketball, and hockey. These 
							sports put you at a high risk of injury from a ball or puck or 
							from a collision with another player.
						</li>
						<li>
							Scuba diving is definitely off-limits during pregnancy. Diving 
							under water may cause dangerous gas bubbles to form in your 
							baby's developing circulatory system.
						</li>
					</ul>
