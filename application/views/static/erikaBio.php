                    What led me to become a doula, and ultimately to decide to pursue 
                    midwifery, is my intense desire to give other women and their partners 
                    what my husband and I had; a positive, life-changing birth experience.    
                    In comparison to our hospital birth experience, our home water births 
                    were family centered, respectful and gentle.  My labors were shorter and 
                    less painful due to the support my husband and I received from our 
                    midwife and to the feeling of security the birth environment brought us.  
                    While homebirth is not for everyone, it is a safe and viable alternative 
                    for any low-risk woman.

                    My midwifery education is through The Michigan School of Traditional 
                    Midwifery.  MSTM is a distance learning program which combines didactic 
                    education with skills conferences.    I continue to consult with the 
                    school, present at MSTM Skills Conferences and mentor students.  In 
                    addition I hold certifications in CPR, First Aid, Neonatal Resuscitation, 
                    Blood Borne Pathogens Safety, and water birth.  I am a DONA trained Birth 
                    and Postpartum doula.  I have been published in Having a Baby Today and 
                    Midwifery Today.  In 2011 I attended The Farm Midwifery Centerâ€™s Advanced 
                    Midwifery Workshop.  I have been serving birthing families since 2003 and 
                    have been a midwife since 2006.
