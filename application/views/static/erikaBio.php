                     I began my college career at Kent State University hoping to pursue 
                     medical research.  My coursework included biology, genetics, chemistry, 
                     anatomy, physiology, evolution, microbiology, and ecology.  As I moved 
                     through the curriculum, I discovered that big pharma and mainstream 
                     medicine did not support my philosophy of holistic living. Our first 
                     child was born in the hospital while I was in my final semester of 
                     college.  My husband and I found her birth very dissatisfying mostly due 
                     to the powerlessness and lack of respect given to us and our baby by the 
                     hospital medical model.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing my college education and having our second child at home 
                    with a midwife, I knew that midwifery was my calling.  Our other five 
                    children have been born at home in water.  We surrounded ourselves with 
                    the right people at the right time, in the place that was right for us. 
                    My labors were shorter and less painful due to the support my husband and 
                    I received from our midwife and to the feeling of security the birth 
                    environment brought us.  While homebirth is not for everyone, it is a safe 
                    and viable alternative for any low-risk woman.

                    My birth and postpartum doula training were through DONA International. 
                    My midwifery education was through The Michigan School of Traditional 
                    Midwifery.  MSTM is a distance learning program which combines didactic 
                    education with skills workshops. I still consult with the school and 
                    mentor students.  I am certified in Neonatal Resuscitation, 
                    Adult/Child/Infant CPR, and first aid. I am waterbirth certified through 
                    Waterbirth International.  Most recently, in August of 2011, I spent a 
                    week at The Farm in Summertown Tennessee refreshing my skills through 
                    their Advanced Midwifery Workshop.
