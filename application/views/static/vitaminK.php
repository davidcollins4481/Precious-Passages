                <p>
					Vitamin K is routinely administered to newborns by intramuscular 
					injection shortly after birth.  The theory behind this is that the 
					newborn has a naturally low level of Vitamin K.  Since Vitamin K is 
					responsible for clotting, it has become routine to administer a shot 
					to boost the newborn's ability to clot.  This practice is not without 
					controversy.  If newborn's needed a "normal" level of vitamin K, would 
					every newborn be born with a "low" level?  Are there benefits to this 
					"low" level?  What are the risks associated with altering the normal 
					physiology of the newborn?  Colostrum is rich in Vitamin K.  Babies who 
					are breastfed obtain immediate protection from their mother's colostrum.  
					Below are links to information regarding the routine administration of 
					Vitamin K.
