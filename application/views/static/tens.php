						What is TENS?
                    </h3>
                    TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) is a method of electrical 
                    stimulation used to provide a degree of symptomatic pain relief by specifically 
                    exciting sensory nerves. TENS units consist of a small machine with controls 
                    (about the size of a cell phone or Palm pilot), connected by lead wires to 
                    electrode pads placed appropriately to alleviate various types of pain. Some 
                    units, such as the LadyTENS, are battery-operated and small enough to carry in 
                    the hand or in a pocket. Most TENS units operate in two modes, a burst or pulse 
                    mode for chronic or low-level pain, and a constant mode for acute, short-lived 
                    pain (such as a labor contraction). When turned on, the TENS unit delivers a 
                    tingly, buzzing sensation to the area under the electrodes. It is thought that 
                    this sensation works in two ways to alleviate labor pain: it causes your body to 
                    release natural pain killers called endorphins, and it acts as a gateway, 
                    blocking deeper pain messages from travelling to your brain.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Does TENS have side effects? Can it cause problems for my baby?
					</h3>
					TENS is non-invasive and has few side effects when compared with drug therapy. 
					The most common complaint is an allergic type skin reaction (about 2% of
					 patients) and this is almost always due to the material of the electrodes, 
					 the conductive gel or the tape employed to hold the electrodes in place.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Does TENS work?
					</h3>
					TENS will not completely eradicate or take away labor pain in the way that an 
					epidural does. Like hydrotherapy, relaxation and breathing techniques, and 
					narcotic analgesia, TENS can lessen the pain and make it easier to tolerate. 
					For women who want to make every effort to avoid pharmacologic pain relief 
					(epidural or narcotic), TENS is an option that may help. Used in combination 
					with other methods by a motivated woman, it is even more likely to do this. For 
					women who think they may want an epidural when labor is intense, TENS can be 
					helpful to get through the early labor until the point when it is appropriate 
					to have an epidural placed.
					<br/><br/>
					Success is not guaranteed with TENS. In several reviews of the research 
					literature, no study was found that recorded any difference in pain intensity or 
					pain relief scores between TENS and controls (women who did not receive TENS) 
					during labor. In 8 of 10 reports, it was recorded that women required additional 
					analgesic interventions, that is, other methods of pain relief in addition to 
					TENS.

					Interestingly, a Cochrane systematic review did find high-frequency TENS to be 
					helpful for dysmenorrhea or painful cramps with menstruation.

					Perhaps if studies of TENS to alleviate labor pain were focused on early labor, 
					they would find a more positive result.

					<h3>
						What do women who have used TENS during labor say?
					</h3>
					Women who have commented anecdotally on the use of TENS (comments can be found on 
					the Gentle Birth and Baby Centre web pages) agree that it is more useful for 
					early labor, and ceases to be helpful in the second stage when the mother is 
					pushing the baby out. Some typical comments follow:
					<br/><br/>
					"I found TENS an absolute God-send and would use it again like a shot. It got me 
					through most of my labour until transition without much else and I found it 
					pleasant to use. I want one for period pain but they cost too much! :-( My friend 
					used hers for post-Caesarean pain to great effect, and it's also good for coping 
					with after-pains. Most of the women I've spoken to, who used it first time, say 
					they would absolutely use it again."
					<br/><br/>
					"I used a TENS machine during my labor. I borrowed it from a British friend who 
					used it for all her labors. She benefited greatly from it. I found it very 
					helpful up to a certain point. You hold a little device that you push if you want 
					another "shot" of tensing. When I was at the last point of active labor it 
					started annoying me, so I pulled it off. But until that point it really helped 
					(this was my third baby so I had done two before without any TENS). It especially 
					helps with posterior birth because it really relieves backache. You have to take 
					it off if you want to take a bath or shower, however, and you have to make sure 
					you stick the little pads on exactly the right places on the back."
					<br/><br/>
					"I was using a TENS unit for back pain while I was pregnant and decided to try 
					it during labor. I had an unmedicated labor that lasted about 29 hours. Most of 
					it wasn't so bad. I went into labor Saturday afternoon, put on the TENS until 
					Sunday morning and wore it until I got to transition. At one point I figured it 
					wasn't helping because I was still feeling the contractions and they were pretty 
					tough but when I turned it off I *KNEW* it had been helping! The contractions 
					were much stronger feeling and hurt more in my back when I turned it off. I 
					turned it back on and left it until the tingling started to annoy me. At that 
					point I was very near pushing and I don't think it would have helped much then. 
					The pushing contractions were much stronger and were in a totally different place 
					that the labor contractions. Anyway, I loved mine and I plan to use it again!"
					<br/><br/>
					"I used tens with my first child 3 years ago and found it effective for the first 
					part of labour - its a strange sensation and a good distraction. it only works up 
					to a point though, i will be using it again when my 2nd baby is due at the end of 
					feb 2001."
					<br/><br/>
					"I have given birth thirteen times (yes, thats 13 times!) and used a Tens machine 
					for one birth and an epidural with one and nothing for the other eleven.The tens 
					machine worked immediately.... I would say that the pain relief was maybe three 
					quarters as good as the epidural. Pretty impressive to me given the low cost and 
					apparent lack of side effects. Although the epidural was unquestionably 
					effective, it does have its own set of possible risks, and my baby did not 
					breathe spontaneously at birth. He had an apgar of 4 at one minute. Everyone 
					insists that the epidural doesn't cause this effect, but I wonder, since my 
					daughter, my sister-in-law, and two neighbors all had babies who needed 
					resucitating at birth following epidurals."
					<br/><br/>
					Not all comments were positive. One woman said,
					<br/><br/>
					"I don't think that it worked, in fact it seemed to have the opposite effect for 
					me, when I felt a contraction and pushed the button the electrical impulse seemed 
					to cause the contraction to get stronger so I gave in and moved on to gas and air 
					(which rocks!!)."

						How do I find a TENS unit to use during my labor?
					</h3>
					Some midwives or doulas have a TENS unit that they can rent to you. Some 
					hospitals have TENS units, usually for the physical therapy department, that you 
					can request while you are a patient. In the U.K., there are a number of websites 
					that will hire a TENS unit, including BabyCare TENS and Pulsar Tens. A new 
					company that works closely with midwives in the U.K. is Maternity TENS Hire. 
					TENS units can also be hired from most Boots Pharmacies. In the U.S., it is 
					harder to find a TENS unit for rent; some hospitals rent TENS units through 
					their physical therapy or rehabilitation departments, and there are some websites 
					that rent TENS units. If you have trouble locating a source, email me.

					Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the transmission of 
					low-voltage electrical impulses from a handheld battery-powered generator to the 
					skin via surface electrodes. Long used in much of the world for control of 
					chronic or postsurgical pain as an adjunct to or replacement for pain medication, 
					TENS was introduced into maternity care in Scandinavia in the 1970s. Today it is 
					widely used and rated highly by users in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, parts 
					of Canada, and in other countries. In fact, TENS units, designed for convenient 
					use by the woman in labor, are available for rent without a doctor's or midwife's 
					order in drugstores and medical equipment companies in those countries. TENS is 
					not widely used for labor pain in the United States, although physical therapists 
					can provide TENS units and teach expectant parents how to use them.
					<br/><br/>
					To relieve labor pain, one pair of electrodes is placed paravertebrally at the 
					level of T10-L1 and another at the level of S2 to S4 (Figure 2). The woman 
					controls the intensity of the current by turning a dial and varies the 
					stimulation pattern with a thumb switch or by adjusting dials on her TENS unit. 
					TENS causes a buzzing or prickling sensation that may reduce her awareness of 
					contraction pain.

					<h3>
						Effectiveness of TENS in Reducing Pain and Suffering During Labor
					</h3>
					A 1997 systematic review of 8 trials of TENS for labor,<sup>[60]</sup> including a 
					total of 812 women, found that women's ratings on a visual analog scale during labor 
					or postpartum assessments by the women indicated no less pain with TENS than usual care. 
					However, analgesics were used less by TENS users (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.96), and 54% of 
					TENS users stated they would use it in a future labor (compared with 32% who had "sham" 
					TENS).
					<br/><br/>
					One more recent trial of TENS,<sup>[61]</sup> including 104 women, found shorter 
					duration of first-stage labor among nulliparas (12 &plusmn; 4 hours vs 14 &plusmn; 
					4 hours, P &lt; .001) and multiparas (9 &plusmn; 3 vs 10 &plusmn; 3, P &lt; .005), 
					and later introduction of pain medication (5.2-cm dilation vs 2.5 cm among 
					nulliparas, P &lt; .0001; 7.1 cm vs 4 among multiparas, P &lt; .0001) in the TENS 
					users than the control groups. The majority of all TENS users considered TENS 
					effective for pain relief and would use it again in future labors.
					<br/><br/>
					Experienced practitioners state that TENS may be more effective if initiated in 
					early labor, presumably to allow for a build-up in endorphin production before 
					the pain becomes severe. Furthermore, TENS may be more effective for relief of 
					back pain than labor pain in general, but only 2 older studies have investigated 
					this possibility.<sup>[62,63]</sup>
					<br/><br/>
					The satisfaction expressed by women with TENS may relate to other factors beside 
					pain relief. TENS allows the woman to be in control of its use, allows 
					ambulation, has no effects on her mental state, and gives an option to those who 
					wish to avoid or delay medications.
					<br/><br/>
					There are few potential side effects from TENS when used by healthy individuals. 
					Although rare if used with electronic fetal-monitoring equipment, TENS may 
					interfere with the output from the monitor, in which case, either the TENS or the 
					monitor should be discontinued or used intermittently. There is expense involved 
					in renting or purchasing the units, and presently, it is difficult for Americans 
					to obtain the units that are designed for use during labor. At present, suppliers 
					of obstetrical TENS units can be found on the Internet.
					<br/><br/>
					TENS provides modest pain relief benefits and is a satisfying option for most 
					women who use it. Its efficacy in relieving back pain deserves further study.
