                <p>
					There seems to be an increasing misconception that because a plant 
					(herb) is "natural" it is harmless.  This is simply not true.  The 
					same caution should be used with herbal therapies as is used with 
					pharmacological drugs because no herb is one-hundred percent safe.  
					Hemlock is deadly; aspirin in high doses will cause bleeding.  
					Both are natural products with potent side effects.  It is imperative 
					to know with certainty which plant you are using, where the plant was 
					gathered, how it was processed, any possible interactions with 
					medications or foods, and what the potential side effects are.
                </p>
                <p>
					If you plan to gather your own herbs, please remember that herbs 
					are subject to pollutants and pesticides.  Plants gather pesticides 
					and pollutants from the soil, air and water on which they feed.  
					The way an herb works will depend on how it is prepared, the potency 
					of the herb itself, the interaction between the herb and the individual 
					woman and any pre-existing health problems the woman has.  Additional 
					concern is warranted because when a woman is pregnant, she is treating 
					two patients.  Please know with certainty how many weeks pregnant you 
					are, which other herbs or supplements you are taking, and which herb 
					is the least potent, yet effective, choice to treat the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
					Herbs can be used safely if you observe the following: 
					<ul>
						<li>
							know which herb you are using
						</li>
						<li>
							know where the herb was harvested and how it was processed
						</li>
						<li>
							know the potential side effects and interactions
						</li>
						<li>
							begin with a low dose and slowly increase to get desired effect
						</li>
						<li>
							observe the body carefully for signs of taxation caused by 
							the herb
						</li>
						<li>
							use the least volatile herb that will treat the condition
						</li>
						<li>
							be sure to increase the strength of the body through nutrition 
							before, during and after herbal treatment
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					That being said, there are several safe and effective herbal allies 
					which will ease your pregnancy discomforts, remedy common pregnancy 
					problems and prevent nutrition based issues with far fewer side 
					effects than their pharmacological alternatives.. Please use the 
					following links and articles to learn about which herbs to use and 
					which to avoid during pregnancy.
