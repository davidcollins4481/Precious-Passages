						Nutrition is the cornerstone of a healthy pregnancy.  
					</h3>
					Upfront I will tell you, I have a bias toward Dr. Tom Brewer and 
					his work in the field of pregnancy nutrition.  This does not mean 
					that Dr. Brewer's is the only good diet for pregnant women.  His 
					program has been around since the early seventies.  The diet has 
					been proven over and over to be highly effective in preventing 
					toxemia, gestational diabetes and hosts of other pregnancy 
					complications.

					Dr. Tom Brewer passed away at 5:20 p.m. on Tuesday, November 22, 2005. 
					<br/> <br/>
					Dr. Brewer discovered that poor nutrition was the cause of toxemia in 
					pregnancy. 
					<br/>
					He will be deeply missed.  His work will go on.

						Dr. Thomas Brewer -- developed diet for pregnant women
					</a>
                </p>
                <p>
					In its simplest form, the Brewer Diet recommends 80-100 grams of high 
					quality protein a day for a pregnant woman carrying one baby.  This 
					diet is not Atkins.  This diet is not intended for weight loss.  What 
					you will find is a very well balanced program with protein as its 
					foundation.  While there is no 'carb cutting', I have found that when 
					I focus on getting my required protein, dairy and vegetables,  I 
					naturally include the recommended amount of carbohydrate.  As an 
					added benefit, when you consume a large amount of protein with every 
					meal your blood sugar levels stay consistent.  Stable blood sugar 
					prevents sugar and carbohydrate cravings.  The other benchmarks of 
					the diet are to salt your food to taste , drink to prevent thirst 
					and obtain enough calories to sustain your system AND nourish your 
					baby.
