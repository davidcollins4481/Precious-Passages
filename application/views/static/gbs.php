                   Beta Strep is a bacteria that is normally present in the vaginal area 
                   of some women.  While B-Strep is harmless to the woman, it may cause 
                   severe respiratory problems in the newborn.  For this reason, most 
                   doctors will test for B-Strep at about 37 weeks.  If you are B-Strep 
                   positive, the routine medical protocol is to administer IV antibiotics 
                   to you during labor. 
                </p>
                <p>
					If you are planning a homebirth, you may wish to ask your doctor to 
					perform the test at 35 weeks.  There is an alternative method of 
					antibiotic treatment that involves 4 shots of penicillin (one shot a 
					week for four weeks) which you will want to discuss  with your doctor 
					if you are B-Strep positive. This may also be a wise option to take if 
					you have had a precipitous (less than 2-3 hours) labor in the past. 
                </p>
                <p>
					There are also several holistic treatment options for B-Strep positive 
					women (see links below).  The esteemed researcher Michel Odent, MD has 
					designed a protocol which simply entails washing the vagina with 
					Hibiclense (chlorohexidine) during labor. Odent's protocol has proven 
					to be as effective as IV antibiotics. Read his his article:

				<h4>
					That my baby will become sick from GBS disease....
				</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt>
						If I don't test.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The incidence in the total population is listed a 3 per 1000 for 
						this group.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						If I don't test, but will seek antibiotics with risk factors 
						(ROM>18hours, fever, prematurity)
					</dt>
					<dd>
						These risk factors occur in approximately 25% of the population.
					</dd>
					<dd>
						The incidence of GBS disease in this group is around 1 in 1000.  
						The presence of risk factors identifies less than HALF of those 
						babies who would become ill.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						If I test, am GBS positive and choose to seek antibiotics if a 
						risk factor is identified.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						These risk factors including a positive  GBS culture occurs in 
						approximately 15% of the population.
					</dd>
					<dd>
						The incidence of GBS disease in the group is 0.9 in 1000 of all 
						deliveries or 1 in 25 of deliveries in this group.
