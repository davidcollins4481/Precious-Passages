					The 1970s were a time of increased technological intervention in 
					maternity care, with induction of labour, epidural anaesthesia and 
					operative delivery becoming commonplace.<sup>1</sup>
					Over the next 20 years attitudes began to change, giving more control 
					to expectant parents.<sup>2</sup>
					Touch, in the form of a positive massage during labour, was an area I 
					wanted to explore to determine whether it is a useful way of shifting 
					the focus of active support away from the midwife and towards the 
					birthing partner.
					The following report summarises a review I undertook of my practice of 
					massage techniques in labour.<sup>3</sup>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Background
					</h3>
					Throughout the 17 years that I worked as a community midwife at the 
					John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, I witnessed many changes in attitude 
					and approach. During the 1970s it was common for doctors and midwives 
					to take absolute control over childbearing women, leaving many women 
					feeling disempowered and very dissatisfied with their experiences. 
					Groups such as the NCT evolved in response and actively challenged this 
					type of care,<sup>4,5</sup> emphasising the normality of childbirth.
					<br/><br/>
					During the 1990s alternative and complementary therapies began to gain 
					popularity. Books and courses became available on such topics as 
					massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, homoeopathy and acupuncture.<sup>6,7</sup> 
					There was a shift towards acceptance of complementary therapies, both 
					by the users and the providers of health services. Guidance on the use 
					of complementary therapies is given in the Midwife&rsquo;s Code of Practice, 
					and their use is to be based upon a sound knowledge and appropriate 
					training.<sup>8</sup>
					<br/><br/>
					Massage is one such complementary therapy. It is a form of touch, and 
					as such is an important form of communication. When performed in a 
					positive and conscious way it can provide an active role for a support 
					person. In investigating the physiological changes associated with 
					touch, two small studies are of relevance. 
					<br/><br/>
					The first looked at the effects of massage on 11 preterm infants, and 
					indicated that, while pain results in an increase of cortisol 
					concentrations, the opposite occurs in response to massage.<sup>9</sup>
					<br/><br/>
					The second study shows the effects of connective tissue massage and 
					suggests that it results in a rise in beta endorphins.<sup>10</sup>
				</p>

					<h3>
						The needs of men
					</h3>
					Women and their partners, during the 1980s, were encouraged to play a 
					greater part in their &lsquo;birthing experience&rsquo; and couples became better 
					informed.<sup>11</sup> There has also been an emphasis on the 
					importance of promoting options and choice for childbearing women and 
					their partners.<sup>2</sup> Despite this, many men still do not feel 
					part of the labour process. Some fathers have expressed a need for 
					more support to achieve an active role within the labour experience.
					<h2>
						One commentator has written to men:
					</h2>
					&ldquo;You may be all too aware of the feeling of helplessness and 
					frustration that you are not able to do enough to help your wife, 
					especially with her pain in first stage.&rdquo;<sup>12</sup> In a survey 
					of fathersâ€™ needs<sup>13</sup> the men considered themselves as essentially 
					helpless in supporting their partner with the pain. Furthermore, 
					two men out of the 30 in her survey &ldquo;perceived health professionals 
					as likely to increase the sense of powerlessness with which they 
					viewed labour&rdquo;. Another important finding of this survey is that men 
					want an active role during labour &ldquo;because doing something seems more 
					controlling than doing nothing&rdquo;.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Questions
					</h3>
					As a midwife, I used massage in labour, and the women found it both 
					soothing and comforting. In addition, it gave me a positive, 
					supportive role. I wanted to find out if I could pass this role on to 
					the birthing partner; whether the partner could be more actively 
					involved in the process of labour through the use of massage. I 
					therefore decided to undertake a review of the use of massage in my 
					practice. This took place over a ten-month period. My purpose was to 
					clarify:
					<ul>
						<li>
							How best to implement massage for the woman, with her partner 
							being the primary masseur;
						</li>
						<li>
							How to help the couple become more reliant on each other and not 
							focus entirely on the midwife for support;
						</li>
						<li>
							How couples overall responded to this care option;
						</li>
						<li>
							Whether any modifications of the specific massage techniques were 
							called for;
						</li>
						<li>
							Whether this programme would be of value in the future.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Participants
					</h3>
					During my employment as a community midwife at the John Radcliffe 
					Hospital, I offered massage to women whom I attended antenatally; 
					others were referred to me by my colleagues, and some were women I met 
					in early labour. Altogether, 50 women and their partners were included 
					in the review. All the couples were interested in learning the massage 
					techniques and agreed to complete a questionnaire between two and five 
					days after delivery.<br/><br/>
					The questionnaire included closed and open questions and sought to 
					gain information on their views of their preparation for labour, on 
					their perception of massage for pain relief, the outcome of labour, the 
					couples&rsquo; feelings about the labour and the effects of the massage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Both partners completed the questionnaire.
					</h3>
					Women were not offered massage if they were &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; (for example 
					with hypertensive disorders), if they were anticipating a caesarean 
					section, or if they were planning a waterbirth.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						Massage in action
					</h3>
					At 36 weeks gestation onwards the participating women were asked if 
					they wished to join the massage programme. The massage techniques 
					taught were those described later in this article.<br/><br/>
					Of the 30 nulliparous and 20 multiparous women to whom I taught the 
					techniques, two were booked for home delivery. Two of the nulliparous 
					women declined massage in labour (one of whom subsequently had an 
					elective caesarean section). Overall, I was able to attend the labours 
					of, and therefore observe the massage techniques of, 22 women, 12 of 
					whom were nulliparous and 10 of whom were multiparous.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>
						The effects of massage on labour
					</h3>
					The types of onset of labour, differentiated between the nulliparae 
					and multiparae, are shown in Table 1. Augmentation of labour was 
					noticeably higher in the nulliparous women.

					<br/>
					Nine nulliparae women (33%) did not require any analgesia, and nearly 
					half used just Entonox. <br/>
					It is interesting to note that none of the women received pethidine. 
					In those women who opted for an epidural, the massage was given to 
					them up until the time of the epidural.<br/>
					All the nulliparous women who did not receive any analgesia had a 
					normal delivery. There was 100% spontaneous vaginal delivery in the 
					multiparous women (Table 3).

						Women&rsquo;s views of the effects of massage
					</h3>
					Some of the comments which the women wrote on the questionnaire, on 
					the effects of the massage techniques, were as follows (with the 
					number of women who made the comments in brackets):
					<ul>
						<li>
							Helped to cope with pain (21 nulliparae,16 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Helped with breathing (5 nulliparae,11 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Useful/helpful in labour (23 nulliparae,42 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Relaxing (1 nullipara, 1 multipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Gave control (1 nullipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Poor effect in advanced labour (2 nulliparae, 1 multipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Useful distraction (2 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Gave sense of wellbeing (1 nullipara,1 multipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							A positive contact (20 nulliparae,18 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Invaluable (1 nullipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Reassuring (1 nullipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							 I would recommend it (1 nullipara, 2 multiparae)
						</li>
					</ul>
					These comments suggest that the massage had positive effects, helping 
					women to cope with pain and promoting a positive feeling of labour.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Coping with pain
					</h3>
					Specific comments made by the women about how massage helped them to 
					cope with the pain of labour included:<br/>
					&ldquo;Very useful as a means of pain relief. Used for the first ten hours 
					with breathing techniques as the sole means of relief. It proved very 
					good and I feel it would have been possible to rely on massage, had I 
					not failed to progress, for the entire labour&rdquo; (nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;In some ways (and this is very difficult to describe in words), the 
					massage focused my attention on the pain, but at the same time gave me 
					a way of coping with it. Previous to starting the massage, / had been 
					walking around, almost as though trying to walk away from the pain. The 
					massage was a way of facing up to it&rdquo; (multipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;Good for breathing, rhythm and a distraction from pain&rdquo; (multipara).<br/>
					The effects of massage techniques in combination with the breathing 
					appear to provide a focus for women which was a distraction from the 
					pain.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Feeling in control and reducing anxiety
					</h3>
					The relationship between feeling anxiety, feeling in control and pain 
					relief is sometimes difficult to tease apart, but the following quotes 
					indicate that massage assisted some women in feeling in control of the 
					pain of their contractions:<br/>
					&ldquo;It helped me concentrate on the breathing, which helped me override 
					the pain to the best of my ability, also made me feel in control to a 
					certain degree&rdquo; (nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;I felt that the massage helped me to have more control of the pain. 
					It also seemed to provide pain relief, as I compare contractions I 
					went through without massage with those with the massage. I had no 
					pain relief during my first labour and I found the massage during the 
					second one a much more pleasant way of getting through it&rdquo; (multipara).<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Partners&rsquo; views on the use of massage techniques
					</h3>
					A summary of the comments made by the partners in using the massage 
					techniques is given below:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Helped feeling of involvement (12 nulliparae, 7 multiparae)
						</li>
						<li>
							Helpful/useful (9 nulliparae,10 multiparae) 
						</li>
						<li>
							Practical/positive contribution (7 nulliparae,1 multipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Active role (7 nulliparae,1 multipara) 
						</li>
						<li>
							Togetherness (1 nullipara)
						</li>
						<li>
							Rewarding (1 nullipara)
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Being involved in my partner&rsquo;s labour
					</h3>
					Most partners found that using massage techniques assisted them in 
					being involved and taking an active part in the process of labour. 
					Some of the comments made include:<br/>
					&ldquo;A significant effect. During the very early stage I felt uninvolved 
					and unable to help â€“ a bit of a &lsquo;spare part&rsquo;. When using massage, I 
					felt very much more involved and glad that I was clearly having some 
					impact in assisting pain relief&rdquo; (partner of nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;It enabled me to get more involved in an active way and contribute 
					positively, to help my partner get through the contractions. If not 
					for the massage, I would have held her hand, wiped her face, etc., all 
					very useful, but this way I was able to help her get through the 
					contractions directly&rdquo; (partner of multipara).<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Taking an active role in the birth
					</h3>
					The partners appeared to find it beneficial to take an active role. 
					For some this increased their sense of sharing and involvement at this 
					time:<br/>
					&ldquo;The massage was a very positive aspect of my wife&rsquo;s labour. I felt 
					that I was making a practical contribution to the labour and as a 
					result of this feel that I would take a different approach to massage 
					as a form of pain relief in future&rdquo; (partner of nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;I felt usefully involved during labour, and looking back, feel that 
					I had a part in the baby&rsquo;s delivery&rdquo; (partner of multipara).<br/>
					Partners who took an active role also felt a sense of taking part in 
					the birth of the baby, and their positive contribution reduced their 
					anxiety. The benefits of the partner undertaking the massage are not 
					just the massage itself, but also the specific role they are provided 
					with during labour.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Preparation for massage techniques
					</h3>
					Effective teaching of this type of massage needs to be done on a 
					one-to-one basis, either antenatally or in early labour. Group 
					teaching does not work well, as the women become inhibited when 
					taking their clothes off to learn the techniques. Although the massage 
					techniques in themselves are simple, it is necessary for the couples to 
					practise them for it to work well. An hour taken to teach the partner 
					is very worthwhile.<br/>
					I wanted to find out what women felt about their preparation for the 
					massage. The majority of women appreciated the preparation antenatally 
					and would have liked to have had the opportunity to learn massage 
					techniques to use in pregnancy. Some responses to the preparation are 
					given below.<br/>
					&ldquo;Invaluable - it would have been impossible and impracticable without&rdquo; 
					(nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;Yes, I would have jumped at the chance (to use massage during 
					pregnancy), to help with sleeping, relieving tension and general 
					relaxation&rdquo; (nullipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;Yes - essential!! Particularly synchronising massage and breathing&rdquo; 
					(multipara).<br/>
					&ldquo;The more the better&rdquo; (multipara).
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Conclusion
					</h3>
					This review of my practice of massage suggests that it has a value in 
					achieving positive physical and psychological effects. It may also have 
					a role in reducing the amount of analgesia and promoting women&rsquo;s 
					ability to cope in labour. The positive responses from the partners 
					were centred on their feeling involved and helpful. Massage will not 
					always be a viable care option for everyone and the wishes of the 
					individual to opt out of massage need to be respected. For those who 
					are interested in massage, it is a positive way of giving the birthing 
					partner an active role and therefore empowering the couple.<br/>
					These massage techniques offer one way of overcoming the helplessness 
					felt by many men when they are with women in labour.

					<h3>
						Massage techniques during labour
					</h3>
					What follows is a detailed description of the programme of massage 
					techniques which I devised in response to the woman&rsquo;s needs.
					<h2>
						Specific massage techniques for labour 
					</h2>
					The massage techniques used during the first stage of labour are 
					specifically designed to support the woman with her breathing during 
					contractions. The massage is therefore directional, reasonably firm 
					and rhythmic. Back, leg and arm massage is taught together with the 
					optimum positions to facilitate each of these. Hand and foot massage 
					using circular strokes have no relationship to this 
					breathing/relaxation approach and so are not included in this 
					programme.<br/>
					It is important that the massage is started early in labour so that 
					the couple can get used to working together with the massage and 
					breathing. In the earlier part of the labour the masseur takes the 
					lead from the woman. Likewise when the contractions get stronger and 
					the woman is breathing more quickly, the masseur needs to follow. It 
					is only at the decreasing stage of the contraction that the masseur 
					takes over, slowing down the hand movements so as to help slow the 
					breathing by the end of the contraction and create relaxation.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						Circular hip massage
					</h3>
					<h2>
						Purpose
					</h2>
					This massage is taught primarily for women experiencing back pain 
					during their labour. However, it has also been found to be of use 
					generally during labour.<br/>
					The firmness and repetition of this movement in the area of discomfort 
					aims primarily to help relieve pain. In addition, women may be more 
					able to regulate their breathing by focusing on the upward and downward 
					strokes of the massage. This can help with relaxation.
					<h2>
						Positions
					</h2>
					The woman has to be in a comfortable, relaxed position; what this is 
					will change throughout the labour. The masseur also has to be in a 
					comfortable position to utilise energy, convey calm and prevent injury.<br/>
					Either the woman kneels on the floor (or bed) leaning over a chair or 
					against the head of the bed (or wall) and is supported by cushions or 
					pillows. She can also be on all fours. The masseur kneels directly 
					behind, leaving enough room for movement; or the woman stands with 
					legs apart leaning over a table, against the wall or over a bean bag 
					placed on a bed and the masseur sits on a chair or stool directly 
					behind.
					<h2>
						Massage
					</h2>
					Before the massage begins the masseur warms the base oil in his hands 
					and applies to the area being massaged. Two hands are placed on either 
					side of the spine in the sacral region with the hands pointing in an 
					upward direction and not placed too far under the buttocks. This 
					massage should never be done directly over the spine (Fig 1 &amp; 2).
					<table align="center">

					When the contraction starts the woman is asked to breathe audibly so 
					that the masseur can hear. The massage is essentially extremely simple 
					but needs coordination between the woman and masseur. During 
					inspiration the masseur&rsquo;s hands go upwards as he leans forward. All 
					pressure and energy comes from the body and is transmitted through the 
					hands, which need to remain flexible and fluid.<br/>
					The hands massage up to waist level during the inspiration. Then during 
					the start of expiration the fingers on both hands turn inwards and 
					elbows turn outwards to massage outwards across the back to the hips 
					(Fig. 3).<br/>
					The hands then move smoothly down the sides of the hips until they 
					arrive at the starting position. This is done during expiration. The 
					masseur must perform the whole move smoothly and firmly in time with 
					the breathing and without losing contact with the woman (Fig. 4). These 
					movements continue throughout the contraction.

                <p>
					<h3>
						Whole back massage
					</h3>
					At the end of the contraction the masseur leans further forward if 
					kneeling or stands up if sitting and continues up the back (on either 
					side of the spine) to the upper back, around the shoulders and down 
					each side of the body to the starting point (Fig. 5).<br/>
					This final stroke can be repeated as many times as is wanted and women 
					report that it is extremely relaxing following the contraction. This 
					stroke is performed more slowly and gently, as it is not following any 
					breathing pattern but rather aiding deeper relaxation.

					<h3>
						Upper back/shoulder massage
					</h3>
					This massage can be performed to facilitate breathing and relaxation. 
					The same technique is used as for the circular hip massage, but using 
					the upper back (Fig. 6).

					<h3>
						Sacral pressure massage for labour
					</h3>
					This massage can be used in combination with the circular hip massage 
					at the end of the contraction when the hands return to the starting 
					position, or on its own, depending on what the woman finds most useful 
					at the time. It is done in the positions outlined for the circular hip 
					massage and it follows the same principles: the massage is slow, 
					rhythmic, firm and in time with the breathing. The masseur uses the 
					palm of the hand over the sacral area and massages firmly, in a 
					clockwise direction if using the right hand and anticlockwise if 
					using the left hand (Fig. 7). The hand not being used to massage is 
					supporting the woman either on the hip or shoulder (whichever feels 
					more comfortable). <br/>
					The massage hand should remain flexible and fluid with all the 
					pressure coming through the body.<br/>
					Some women find this massage very helpful if there is intense 
					backache.

					<h3>
						Lower circular back massage from the side
					</h3>
					The masseur performs this massage either standing or kneeling at the 
					woman&rsquo;s side. The optimum positions for the woman are standing, 
					kneeling or on all fours. It can also be done when the woman is 
					sitting, or lying down on her side but is not as easy and possibly not 
					as effective. Only one hand is used. The starting point is the near 
					side hip area, moving across the waist to the opposite hip. The action 
					is done during inspiration (Fig. 8).<br/>
					The massaging hand moves down the side of the hip, the fingers around 
					the curves, down to the buttock, then across and slightly upwards to 
					the sacral area with the heal of the hand and finally back across the 
					near side hip to the starting point (Fig. 9). This is done during 
					expiration. This movement is continued throughout the contraction, 
					with the hand that is not massaging supporting the near side shoulder 
					area. At the end of the contraction the sacral pressure massage can be 
					incorporated, if requested.

					<h3>
						Leg massage
					</h3>
					During the investigator&rsquo;s survey into the use of massage, it became 
					apparent from feedback by the women that they felt &lsquo;lost&rsquo; if the 
					massage stopped during labour and they found that their breathing and 
					relaxation did not work as well. The aim of the leg massage is not 
					primarily to relieve pain, as women do not usually experience pain in 
					their legs during a contraction, but rather to have a directional 
					influence on their breathing. This may help them relax and may 
					therefore indirectly help relieve pain. Some couples also commented 
					that it is very helpful and reassuring to have eye-to-eye contact with 
					each other, which can only happen with this technique. If the woman 
					needs to sit down, e.g. to permit foetal heart monitoring, it is more 
					difficult to continue with back massage, so a leg massage may be 
					substituted. The leg massage is done with the woman sitting either on 
					a chair or on the bed.<br/>
					The masseur kneels, stands or sits in front of the labouring woman and 
					starts the massage on the inner side of each foot with elbows outward 
					and fingers of both hands facing each other (Fig.10).<br/>
					As the contraction begins, the hands move up the inner part of the 
					legs, with the masseur leaning up and forward. The movement continues 
					to the top of the thigh and then around to the hip area. This is done 
					during inspiration. As the leg is considerably longer than the lower 
					back, the movement needs to be faster, ensuring that the smoothness 
					and rhythm is maintained. The hands then move down each side of the 
					outer leg arriving back at the starting point in time with the 
					exhalation.<br/>
					This movement is repeated as many times as is necessary throughout 
					the contraction, making sure that there is no loss of contact with 
					the woman. The masseur has to make sure that he moves well during this 
					massage otherwise strain to his back may result.<br/>
					If the masseur is kneeling to perform the massage then it is advisable 
					to get up and move around in between contractions. If the contractions 
					become stronger and the breathing faster, then it is not possible for 
					the masseur to massage the full length of the leg. In this case the 
					upper or lower portion of the leg massage is chosen, incorporating the 
					rest of the leg as soon as the strength of the contraction starts to 
					fade. This allows the masseur to slow down the massage and direct the 
					woman back into her slower breathing rhythm.
                </p>

					<h3>
						Arm Massage
					</h3>
					This massage is used if it is impossible to massage the back or legs 
					for example during a vaginal examination. It helps to keep the woman 
					focused on her breathing, aiding relaxation and pain relief. It 
					maintains reassuring contact during a possibly frightening experience 
					(e.g. prior to forceps/ventouse delivery) and keeps the partner 
					involved.<br/>
					The masseur stands to the side and holds the woman&rsquo;s hand, supporting 
					the wrist. <br/>
					The massaging hand goes up the inner arm to the shoulder, around and 
					down the outer side of the arm back to the hand. As with all the other 
					massages outlined, it works in combination with breathing; up on 
					inspiration, down on expiration.
                </p>

					<h3>
						Conclusion
					</h3>
					The massage techniques described here encourage women and their 
					partners to play a more active part in the birthing experience. 
					While the importance of positive touch from the midwife cannot be 
					overstated, these techniques are designed to give control to the 
					couple, helping them to become more reliant on each other, instead 
					of focusing entirely on the midwife for support.
