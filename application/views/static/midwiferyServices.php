					I will perform the Newborn Metabolic Screening test during the 
					3 - 5 day visit.  I am authorized by the state of Ohio to sign 
					for verification of pregnancy and live birth so you can file for 
					a birth certificate.
                </p>
                
                <p>
					Birth pool use is included in the cost of homebirth services.   
					I will bring the pool to your house during labor and remove it 
					after the birth.   You only need to supply a full sized sheet 
					or blanket to place over the protective plastic floor tarp so 
					you don't slip on wet plastic when entering or exiting the tub.
                </p>
                
                <p>
					Please consider ordering your birth kit from In His Hands.  
					My family has been using this company for 8 years.  In His 
					Hands is a family run Christian company.  They have helped 
					me create a custom birth kit for my clients.  When you order, 
					just type in my name and they will send you the kit. The cost, 
					including shipping, is $48.

                    It is my goal to provide continuous, high quality support to my 
                    clients in the atmosphere of their choice.    When you choose 
                    homebirth, you have the unique opportunity to create your own, 
                    very special, very private birth environment.  I respectfully 
                    honor any birth wishes you have so long as they do not compromise 
                    the health of mother or child.  My service area includes but is not 
                    limited to the Cleveland/Akron/Canton area of Ohio.  If you think 
                    you are close to my service area and desire a homebirth, call me.  
                    I will travel.   Homebirth does not need to be prohibitively 
                    expensive.  In fact, cost should be your last concern. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
					It is my belief that every family deserves the option of a 
					homebirth.   To this end, I work to keep my costs to a minimum.  
					Payment arrangements can be made. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
					It is entirely possible to have the birth experience you want 
					and deserve.   Much  research has shown that when women and 
					their partners are provided with continuous, compassionate support, 
					they recall the birth experience with greater satisfaction and bond 
					to their infants sooner, even if the experience they had wasn't 
					what they would describe as "ideal".  My goal is to give you the 
					gift of a birth experience you will WANT to remember.  Please 
					feel free to e-mail me with any questions or comments at
					<a href="mailto:erikao@preciouspassage.com"> 
						erikao@preciouspassage.com

					I also welcome phone calls at 330 577-5180.
