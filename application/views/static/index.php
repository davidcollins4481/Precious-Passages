                I specialize in direct-entry midwifery and doula 
                services, particularly in the home setting. I service 
                the Cleveland, Akron, and Canton area of Ohio. 
                As a midwife and doula I strives to give you the

                    Erika Obert founded Precious Passage Birth Services in 2004 to serve 
                    birthing families in the Northeast Ohio area as a doula.  Since that 
                    time, the business has expanded to offer home birth midwifery as well 
                    as several other services.  Every member of Precious Passage Birth 
                    Services' staff believes that birth can be a transformative event in a 
                    woman's life.  It is our heartfelt desire to give you the gift of a birth 
                    experience that you will want to remember.

                    I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.
                    That myth is more potent than history.
                    That dreams are more powerful than facts.
                    That hope always triumphs over experience.
                    That laughter is the only cure for grief.
                    And I believe that love is stronger than death.
