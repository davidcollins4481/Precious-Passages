                    Good medicine demands that diagnosis and treatment of any disease fulfill four criteria:
                    <ul>
						<li>
							The condition has to pose a health risk;
						</li>
						<li>
							Diagnosis must accurately distinguish between those who have the disease and those who don't;
						</li>
						<li>
							Treatment should be effective; and
						</li>
						<li>
							The benefits of diagnosis and treatment should outweigh the risks.
						</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					An entire medical industry has grown up around diagnosing and treating 
					gestational diabetes (GD) in the belief that doing so prevents perinatal 
					deaths, congenital anomalies, neonatal complications, macrosomic babies, 
					and because of fetal macrosomia, birth injuries and excessive cesarean 
					rates. However, diagnosis and treatment of gestational diabetes don't 
					fulfill any of the above criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
					To begin with, GD doesn't fit the definition of a disease. GD as a concept 
					began in 1964 when O'Sullivan and Mahan performed a 100g 3- hour oral 
					glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on 752 pregnant women and tracked all women 
					with at least two values above two standard deviations beyond the mean to 
					see if hyperglycemic women were predisposed to develop diabetes down the 
					road (O'Sullivan 1964). They were, leading the two researchers to conclude 
					that the metabolic stress of pregnancy revealed a woman's "pre-diabetic 
					status." This should not surprise anyone since overweight women are more 
					likely to have hyperglycemia in pregnancy and to develop diabetes later in 
					life.
                </p>
                <p>
					Since insulin-dependent diabetes was known to threaten the fetus, 
					researchers extrapolated that sub-diabetic glucose elevations might also do 
					harm. This leap in logic was faulty on its face because GD does not share 
					the risk factors of either type of true diabetes. In Type I diabetes, 
					extremes of low and high blood glucose early in pregnancy can cause 
					congenital anomalies or kill the forming embryo. Gestationally diabetic 
					women make normal or above-normal amounts of insulin and have normal blood 
					sugar metabolism in the first trimester. With either Types I or II, 
					diabetes of long standing may damage maternal blood vessels and kidneys, 
					causing hypertension or kidney complications. These may in turn jeopardize 
					the fetus. Gestational diabetics do not have long- standing diabetes. The 
					one problem GD shares with both types is that chronic hyperglycemia can 
					overfeed the fetus, resulting in macrosomia (generally defined as birth 
					weight greater than 4000 g) or large-for- gestational-age (LGA) (greater 
					than the 90th percentile) babies.
                </p>
                <p>
					Logic notwithstanding, these concerns launched a series of studies into the 
					risks of mild glucose elevations. Unfortunately, they were badly flawed.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Studies selected women for glucose testing based on such factors as 
							prior still birth or hypertension in the current pregnancy and 
							then compared outcomes with the general population. Hunter and 
							Keirse observe that according to Sutherland and Stowers' 1975 
							edition of CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM IN PREGNANCY AND THE NEWBORN, 
							the rate of fetal loss increases eightfold as the number of 
							indications for glucose tolerance testing increasing from one to 
							four. Glucose intolerance does not add to this risk (Hunter and 
							Keirse 1989).
						</li>
						<li>
							Studies included women who were known diabetics prior to pregnancy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Studies failed to account for confounding factors such as that 
							glucose intolerance associates with increasing maternal weight 
							and age, which themselves are strong independent predictors of 
							macrosomia and maternal hypertension.
						</li>
						<li>
							Studies used management protocols that increased risks such as 
							starvation diets, early elective induction, and withholding 
							nourishment from the newborn.
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					In addition, glucose level turned out to be a poor predictor of macrosomia. 
					Other factors such as race, age, parity, sex, and especially maternal 
					weight, far outweighed glucose intolerance in determining birth weight. 
					Hunter and Keirse observed that GD mothers had a 3-fold risk of giving 
					birth to a baby weighing over 4500 g compared with normoglycemic women. 
					However, a woman weighing over 90 kg had a 26-fold risk of having a baby 
					this heavy compared with normal weight women (Hunter and Keirse 1989). 
					Oats and colleagues could not find a significant association between 
					glucose levels and birth weight until birth weight exceeded the 90th 
					percentile. Even then, 77 percent of women had normal glucose tolerance 
					(Oats et al. 1980).
                </p>
                <p>
					Nonetheless, researchers concluded that mildly deviant glucose values in 
					pregnancy constituted a new form of diabetes that required diagnosis, 
					surveillance, and treatment. Researchers have gone on adding rooms and 
					stories to the GD edifice, never noticing that they have built a house on 
					sand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, the OGTT, the standard diagnostic test, has many problems. A 
					diagnostic test should be reproducible, its thresholds should be values at 
					which morbidity either first appears or incidence greatly increases, and 
					normal ranges should apply to the population undergoing testing. The OGTT 
					is none of the above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obstetricians adopted O'Sullivan and Mahan's curve as the normative curve 
					for all pregnant women, but it is not representative. For one thing, 
					O'Sullivan and Mahan tested women without regard to length of gestation, 
					whereas today, women are typically tested at the beginning of the third 
					trimester. Glucose values rise linearly throughout pregnancy, but no 
					corrections have been made for this. For another thing, O'Sullivan and 
					Mahan studied a population that was 60 percent white and 40 percent black. 
					Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian women average higher blood sugars 
					than black or white women. Since diagnostic thresholds are set at two 
					standard deviations beyond the mean, values for O'Sullivan and Mahan's 
					population have arbitrarily been established as the norms for all women. 
					This means that some women are being identified as diseased simply because 
					of race.
				</p>
				<p>
					Worse yet, studies show that when pregnant women undergo two OGTTs a week 
					or so apart, test results disagree 22 percent to 24 percent of the time 
					(Catalano et al. 1993) (Harlass et al. 1991). An individual's blood sugar 
					values after ingesting glucose (or food) vary widely depending on many 
					factors. For this reason, the OGTT has been abandoned as a diagnostic test 
					for true diabetes in favor of excessive fasting glucose values, which show 
					much greater consistency, or postprandial values of 200 mg.dl or more, 
					which are rare. Moreover, pregnancy compounds problems with 
					reproducibility. Because glucose levels rise linearly throughout 
					pregnancy, a woman could "pass" a test in gestational week 24 and "fail" 
					it in week 28. These same problems hold true for the glucose screening 
					test that precedes the OGTT (Sacks et al. 1989) (Watson 1989).
				</p>
				<p>
					More importantly, no threshold has ever been demonstrated for onset or 
					marked increase in fetal complications below levels diagnostic of true 
					diabetes. O'Sullivan and Mahan chose their cutoffs for convenience in 
					follow-up, but all studies since then have used their criteria or some
					 modification thereof as a threshold for pathology in the current 
					 pregnancy. Numerous studies since have documented that birth weights and 
					 other outcomes fail to correlate with O'Sullivan's or anybody else's 
					 thresholds.
				</p>
				<p>
					A test with arbitrary diagnostic thresholds is akin to claiming that all 
					people over six feet tall have a growth abnormality or all people with a 
					cough and a fever have pneumonia. The authors of A GUIDE TO EFFECTIVE CARE 
					IN PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH relegate "screening for gestational diabetes" 
					to "Forms of Care Unlikely to be Beneficial" (Enkin 1995).
				</p>
				<p>
					The original intent of treating GD was preventing excess perinatal 
					mortality and congenital anomalies. Whatever the cause of increased 
					deaths, it wasn't hyperglycemia. O'Sullivan and colleagues randomly 
					assigned gestational diabetics to treatment with diet and insulin and 
					compared outcomes among treated diabetics, untreated diabetics, and a 
					normoglycemic control population. They found more perinatal deaths in the 
					GD population, treated or not (O'Sullivan et al. 1966). Perinatal 
					mortality statistics among non-insulin dependent diabetics remained 
					unchanged between 1946 and 1972 in a Copenhagen study despite aggressive 
					treatment throughout the timespan (Pedersen, JL et al. 1974) (Pedersen J 
					1977). Conversely, a Swedish study showed a marked reduction in perinatal 
					mortality rates between 1961 and 1971, also while treating vigorously 
					(Karlsson et al. 1972).
				</p>
				<p>
					As for congenital anomalies, GD cannot cause congenital anomalies because 
					glucose metabolism is normal in the first trimester. Even if it did, 
					testing isn't done until the third trimester.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main rationale for current GD management is to reduce the incidence of 
					birth injuries and cesarean section by reducing the incidence of 
					macrosomia. The goal of reducing birth weight raises philosophical 
					problems. As with glucose values, doctors are defining deviation beyond an 
					arbitrary point as inherently pathological. Moreover, can we justify 
					manipulating the growth mechanism of a group of babies roughly 75 percent 
					to 80 percent of whom will fall below the 90th percentile for weight if 
					left alone?
				</p>
				<p>
					Philosophical considerations aside, we have little evidence that GD 
					management succeeds. As mentioned above, macrosomia associates with 
					maternal weight, age, race, parity, and male fetus. Maternal overweight 
					cannot be rectified during pregnancy; the rest cannot be altered at all. 
					According to M.J. Stephenson, there have been only four randomized trials 
					of diet or diet and insulin. All were flawed and taken together achieved a 
					reduction in birth weight of 87 g, a benefit "of questionable clinical 
					significance" (Stephenson 1993). A GUIDE TO EFFECTIVE CARE IN PREGNANCY 
					AND CHILDBIRTH also lists insulin and diet therapy for GD under "Forms of 
					Care Unlikely to be Beneficial."
				</p>
				<p>
					Santini and Ales report results from a national trial that occurred in the 
					early 1980's when some doctors at Cornell University Medical Center 
					screened women for GD routinely and others did not. No differences in 
					perinatal mortality, morbidity, LGA or macrosomia rates were found between 
					screened and unscreened populations, but women in the screened population 
					were more likely to have primary cesarean sections (19 percent versus 12 
					percent), more clinic visits, more fetal surveillance tests, and more 
					prenatal hospitalization (Santini et al. 1990).
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-randomized trials show that diet modification rarely works without 
					severely limiting calories or the liberal or universal use of insulin. 
					Even where it does work, only two studies of GD management reduced 
					operative delivery or cesarean rates to reasonable levels, the main point 
					of preventing macrosomia (Langer et al. 1994) (Coustan et al. 1984). In 
					both studies, doctors knew which women were treated and which were 
					controls. If they believed their therapy prevented macrosomia, which other 
					work shows they did, this belief could well have influenced management 
					decisions. A third study also reported similar cesarean rates in GD women 
					and the total hospital population, but these were 27 percent and 25 
					percent respectively (Thompson et al. 1994).
				</p>
				<p>
					As Santini and Ales' study suggests, not only does GD management offer 
					little benefit, it confers risks, the gravest being a marked increase in 
					cesarean section. The cesarean rate in a population of gestational 
					diabetics cared for by midwives was 9 percent to 11 percent including 
					women transferred to obstetric management, or about half the primary 
					cesarean rate reported in populations managed by obstetricians in the same 
					or an earlier time period (O'Brien et al. 1987). Goldman and colleagues 
					reported that gestational diabetics had one-third more cesareans compared 
					with a matched population with normal glucose tolerance, although birth 
					weights were similar (Goldman et al. 1991). In another study, gestational 
					diabetics were randomly assigned to insulin or standard treatment in the 
					third trimester in an effort to minimize macrosomia. Insulin reduced LGA 
					rates to 13 percent compared with LGA rates of 45 percent in the diet 
					group and 38 percent in the group that refused randomization. Despite 
					this, cesarean rates were 14 percent and 21 percent in the diet-treated 
					groups versus 43 percent in the insulin-treated group, a difference 
					attributed to transferring women on insulin to the high-risk service 
					(Buchanan 1994).
				</p>
				<p>
					Many doctors view high cesarean rates as a reasonable trade-off for 
					preventing shoulder dystocia. This ignores that many shoulder dystocias 
					occur in non-macrosomic infants (Keller 1991) and that the increase in 
					cesarean rate for infants weighing over 4000 g has not improved outcomes 
					(Boyd et al. 1983); not to mention the role typical obstetric management 
					plays in causing shoulder dystocia.
				</p>
				<p>
					Increased likelihood of cesarean is not the only risk of GD management. 
					Insulin increases the risk of small-for-gestational-age babies and causes 
					symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (Langer et al. 1994) (Buchanan et al. 
					1994). Reducing calories by more than one-third in overweight gestational 
					diabetics causes ketosis (Knopp et al. 1991). Finally, the poor 
					predictability of the fetal weight estimates and surveillance tests 
					doctors feel obliged to order, even the belief that GD is a high-risk 
					condition, undoubtedly lead to countless unnecessary inductions and 
					operative deliveries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Few have noticed that the diagnosis and treatment of GD is a spectacular 
					failure. A review article analyzes the OGTT, finds it worthless, and 
					recommends continuing to use it to diagnose GD (Nelson 1988). After 
					showing that current cutoffs fail to discriminate a group of women at 
					high risk for macrosomia, obstetricians conclude in defiance of logic that 
					they should lower the values or that insulin should be given to more women 
					or that cutoffs should be chosen by fiat (Sacks et al. 1995) (Neiger 
					et al. 1991) (Weiner 1988) (Tallarigo et al. 1986). Researchers take note 
					that sonography to estimate fetal weight did no better than a coin toss at 
					predicting macrosomia and recommended it anyway (Combs et al. 1993). 
					Doctors find that rigid glycemic control did not improve infant outcomes 
					and assume that means they should try harder (Hod et al. 1980). Goldman 
					and colleagues, with similar birth weights but one-third more cesareans in 
					the GD group, congratulated themselves on the success of their management 
					(Goldman et al. 1991). The gestational diabetes literature reads more like 
					ALICE IN WONDERLAND than science.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, midwives can winnow some grain from the chaff. Maternal weight has 
					the strongest correlation with macrosomia rate; it makes sense to advise 
					heavily overweight women to lose weight before becoming pregnant. 
					Pregnancy makes extra demands on insulin production; to minimize the 
					pressure, pregnant women should eat a diet low in simple sugars, high in 
					complex carbohydrates and fiber, and moderate in fat. Moderate, regular 
					exercise also improves glucose tolerance. Within the GD population lurk a 
					few women who were either undiagnosed pregestational diabetics or who were 
					tipped into true diabetes by the metabolic stress of pregnancy; a fasting 
					glucose to screen for them might be prudent. And, of course, midwives 
					already use strategies that help women minimize the likelihood of 
					operative delivery or birth injury. Finally, to reduce the chance of 
					neonatal hypoglycemia, the baby should be put to breast soon after the 
					birth, especially if the baby is big, small, or the labor has been 
					difficult.
