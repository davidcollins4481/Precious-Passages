                <p>
                    Mention Labor and Delivery to an expectant mom in her last trimester, 
                    and chances are good that her heart will begin to race, her mind floods 
                    with concern and in some cases, panic. She knows that the day is coming 
                    when a force much bigger than herself will take over and her body will 
                    govern itself completely. For some women this is a very fearful event, 
                    but for a Hypnobabies mom, it is an eagerly anticipated challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
					These wise women use hypnosis to eliminate pain and fear from the birthing 
					experience. In the past, the word "hypnosis" conjured up images of stage 
					hypnotists re-creating Elvis, or mesmerizing others into embarrassing 
					situations. Now it is common for hypnosis to be used therapeutically in 
					many areas of medicine, dental and surgical anesthesia and personal therapy 
					sessions. Even so, there are many misconceptions regarding hypnosis that 
					can dissuade those contemplating this powerful tool.<br/>
					Here are a few FACTS: 
					<ul>
						<li>
							All hypnosis is self-hypnosis; the hypnotherapist is only the guide. 
							A person chooses to enter into a hypnotic state, stay in and come 
							out at will.
						</li>
						<li>
							Approximately 90-95% of the population can be hypnotized. 
							Willingness, belief and motivation have great influence over 
							hypnotizability. 
						</li>
						<li>
							During hypnosis you are neither asleep nor unconscious, and will 
							always "come out" whenever you wish. You are always in complete 
							control. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Stronger-minded and stronger-willed people are easier to hypnotize; 
							not the other way around as is usually assumed.
						</li>
						<li>
							You cannot be made to divulge information or do anything against 
							your will while in hypnosis. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Hypnosis is not Satanic or religion-oriented at all, just a way to 
							direct your inner mind toward the positive for great personal 
							benefit. 
						</li>
						<li>
							We are all in states of hypnosis many times a day already! 
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>
						What about Childbirth Hypnosis Classes? 
					</h3>
					When learning how to use hypnosis for childbirth, you are taught an 
					understanding of how the uterine muscles will work efficiently together, 
					as they were designed to do, when the body is completely relaxed. The depth 
					of relaxation necessary can easily be achieved with hypnosis so you learn 
					these skills in class, and practice them at home every day until your baby 
					arrives. Important: Comfort in childbirth depends on much more than deep 
					relaxation, so you are also taught the most in-depth hypnotic anesthesia 
					techniques that exist. These make a huge difference in creating your truly 
					comfortable birthing experience, and are easily learned and practiced. 
					<br/><br/>
					Your Birth Partner can have a very integral role in the preparation process: 
					listening to the CDs, reading the handouts and guiding the Hypno-mother 
					into deep relaxation with hypnosis scripts. They are also an invaluable 
					part of the labor and birth process as they help you to focus and 
					concentrate, as well as supporting you physically. Please note: Mothers 
					without partners can easily learn, practice and use Hypnobabies on their 
					own. All aspects of Labor and Birth are covered in Hypnobabies classes, as 
					well as information on Nutrition, Exercise, Avoiding Complications and 
					Back Labor, Fear Clearing Sessions, Birth Plans, Consumer Issues and 
					Postpartum as well as much more. 
                </p>

					<h3>
						Fear and Expectation
					</h3>
					In other cultures, childbirth is regarded as a natural, normal event in a 
					woman's life. The birthing women are given support from other women, and 
					children are often present to witness the event. In this way, birth is 
					celebrated and honored. Young girls then grow up with the belief system 
					that birth is a positive event and their expectations of childbirth 
					reflect this attitude. As a result, their births are similar to their 
					predecessors; without pain and fear. They have a positive expectation of 
					childbirth. In our culture, it is very much the opposite. For many 
					generations we have been told that delivering a baby will be untold hours 
					of painfully agonizing work, to be faced with fear and trepidation. We 
					have heard stories from well-meaning friends and family that send shivers 
					up our spines, and so the legacy continues. We experience pain in 
					childbirth, in part because we very much expect to! 
					<br/><br/>
					In hypnosis for childbirth classes, you are taught to surround yourself 
					with only positive people and messages, to create a positive view of 
					childbirth and the expectation that your birthing with be a beautiful, 
					peaceful experience. Hypnobabies’ Fear Clearing Sessions are integral to 
					this process, as they allow you to address fears, work through possible 
					solutions and then release them. Fear in labor can create tension, which 
					creates pain, then more fear, and the cycle continues. Fear and anxiety 
					can also create adrenaline production in the body, causing the labor to 
					become dysfunctional, a common reason for Cesarean Section surgery. 
					Freedom from fear can make a significant difference in the birthing 
					experience. 
					<br/><br/>
					By learning and practicing hypnosis, you are able to enter into 
					self-hypnosis instantly, and create your own natural anesthesia whenever 
					and wherever you need it. This is important as any drugs taken by a 
					laboring woman can be dangerous for her, and especially her baby. Using 
					Hypnobabies, you are in control over your body and emotions, and are an 
					active participant in your birth process. You are always aware of 
					everything around you, and as labor progresses, you’ll go deeper inside 
					yourself, trusting in your body's natural ability to give birth with ease 
					and comfort. Your mind is trained and programmed to give you exactly what 
					you need as you give birth to your baby. 
                </p>

					<h3>
						Too good to be true? 
					</h3>
					Can women give birth without experiencing pain? They can, and there are 
					many variables in labor and birth that can affect the outcome! Couples 
					need to have a positive but realistic view of hypnosis for childbirth. 
					Each pregnant woman and her partner must take responsibility for the 
					choices they make while in labor and how they can affect the dynamics and 
					outcome. Many a wonderful birth has been thwarted by not realizing how to 
					make positive, informed choices and yet these issues are easily addressed 
					and learned in a good consumer oriented childbirth hypnosis class such as 
					Hypnobabies. 
					<br/><br/>
					Without a doubt, all of our Hypno-Moms are much calmer and more relaxed 
					during labor, which automatically creates more comfort, as well as having 
					powerful post-hypnotic suggestions to actually eliminate pain and fear. 
					How effective is this? Statistics vary depending on the goals of each 
					Hypnobabies mother, as well as the dedication and compliance to the 
					program. Our Hypnobabies Instructors all have backgrounds in both 
					hypnotherapy and childbirth education and are able to address each woman's 
					personal needs to help her achieve her goals for childbirth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Statistics: The following are statistics for Hypnobabies only: 
					(our very successful 6 week course, 18 total hours of instruction) 
					<ol>
						<li>
							Pain-free births - 70-75%. Women who report that they felt 
							mostly pressure, tightening or mild cramping sensations. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Pain-free until transition - 15%. Pressure only, until the 10-60 
							minute transitional period, with mild to intense degrees of 
							sensation thereafter. "Very manageable." 
						</li>
						<li>
							Pain-free until active labor – 10%, with mild to intense degrees 
							of sensation thereafter This group can have any number of things 
							that affect their birth experiences; prodromal labor, posterior or 
							asynclitic presentations that do not resolve, other labor 
							complications, emotional issues, lack of support, or they simply 
							did not do their homework! (30 - 45 minutes a day) Hypnosis for 
							childbirth won't help a mother or a couple that is not willing to 
							do the work involved in preparing for their baby's birth.
						</li>
					</ol>
					All women reported that the Relaxation and Fear Clearing in Hypnobabies 
					were invaluable to them during their labors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Benefits of using hypnosis for childbirth: 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fewer drugs or no drugs at all - less risk of side effects on 
							mother and baby.
						</li>
						<li>
							Shorter labors - resistance of the birthing muscles as a 
							response to pain is minimized or eliminated.
						</li>
						<li>
							An awake, energized mother, due to total relaxation 
							throughout the birthing process. 
						</li>
						<li>
							A calm, peaceful birthing environment. A comfortable natural 
							birthing also allows for a joyful, rested mother and a calm baby 
							post-partum. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Breech and posterior babies can be turned using hypnosis.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fewer interventions and complications during labor. 

						</li>
						<li>
							Babies who are better sleepers and nursers due to fewer drugs in 
							their systems. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					It is well worth the time to look into hypnosis for childbirth as an 
					option, both for yourself and for your baby. Natural Childbirth without 
					intense discomfort has many benefits to mom and baby, and the deep 
					relaxation has even helped many a nervous dad to enjoy pregnancy and 
					childbirth, since they experience hypnosis in Hypnobabies class as well! 
					In addition, the skills you will learn for relaxation and hypnosis will 
					benefit you for the rest of your life.
