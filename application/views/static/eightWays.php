                    Eight Ways to Increase the Safety and Comfort of Childbirth
                    <h3>
						By Dr. Kathy Foulser, Naturopathic Physician

                <p>
                    Congratulations! You're having a baby. Or perhaps you're thinking about 
                    becoming pregnant. It's never too early to start planning for a peaceful, 
                    safe, healthy pregnancy and birth. All around the world, women are 
                    awakening the memory that giving birth is a natural, normal physiological 
                    process. Women are empowering themselves to allow pregnancy and birth to 
                    unfold in a peaceful, comfortable, loving, even sacred way.
                </p>
                <p>
					This article will suggest eight ways to increase your comfort and health 
					while you are pregnant and as you bring your precious child into the world. 
					Take a few moments to read each suggestion. After all, what can be more 
					important than ensuring your baby's optimal development and safe arrival?
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						1: Educate yourself.
					</h3>
					Read. Formulate opinions about how childbirth is viewed by the medical 
					profession and how you view it yourself. Talk to women who have given 
					birth naturally. Spend a few minutes imagining what a "perfect" birth 
					would be like for you and your baby, and what it would take to have that 
					experience. Develop a list of questions and ask your doctor, nurse, or 
					midwife to answer them. Copy this article and take it to your next prenatal 
					appointment.
					<br/><br/>
					Remember that health care providers are just people: they have the 
					expertise of their medical training, but in this information age it's 
					difficult to keep up with the new developments in any profession. You have 
					the time and motivation to read up on new, non-medical and alternative 
					choices available to birthing mothers.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						2: Choose your health care providers carefully.
					</h3>
					After reading, talking to new mothers in your area, and developing an idea 
					of the kind of pregnancy and birth care you want, interview prospective 
					health care providers. Don't choose a provider simply because they're 
					nearby or assisted a family member’s birth.
					<br/><br/>
					Choose a doctor, nurse, or midwife who will support your wishes. Talk to 
					many providers to get a sense of the differences in personality and 
					approach to birthing. Write a birth plan and discuss it with prospective 
					providers. Remember that health care providers are human, just like you. 
					You will get along well with some and not with others. Some will enjoy 
					empowering you to have the birth you want, while others will want to do it 
					their way.
					<br/><br/>
					Consider having a home birth. Home birth doctors and nurses have just as 
					much expertise as those who work in hospitals. They carry emergency 
					equipment and have admitting privileges at local hospitals, so if necessary 
					you and your baby can be transported to the hospital. Some of the most 
					amazing, sacred births I've seen have been in the comfort and privacy of 
					the family home.
					<br/><br/>
					Hire a midwife and/or a doula. Doulas aren't medical providers: they are 
					present solely to be your advocate and support person. Check with the 
					hospital or home birth agency to make sure your doula will be allowed to 
					stay with you at all times. If you choose a midwife, don't forget to 
					interview her (or him): midwifery care varies by the practice and 
					individual midwife.
					<br/><br/>
					Consider laboring and even delivering the baby in water. Water is a 
					wonderfully soothing environment for labor and delivery. The Swiss study 
					indicates that the concern about babies aspirating water is unfounded. Be 
					sure to ask your health care provider if they will support you in this and 
					whether they have a birthing tub on the premises and are willing to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						3. Eat a healthy diet.
					</h3>
					Pregnant women are eating for two, but your baby doesn't need as many 
					calories as an adult does. Don't use your pregnancy as an excuse to pig 
					out on junk food. If you find you're craving lots of unhealthy food, 
					consider learning 
					<a href="http://eft.mercola.com/" target+"_blank">EFT</a> to help.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Eat only organic meat, produce, and dairy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure you get adequate amounts of essential fatty acids.
						</li>
						<li>
							Eat plenty of raw food.
						</li>
						<li>
							Get a good juicer and use it daily. Fresh vegetable juice is an 
							excellent source of nutrients.
						</li>
						<li>
							Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
						</li>
					</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						4. Address your emotions.
					</h3>
					Acknowledge and release any anxiety, fear, or other emotions that could be 
					triggered during labor and interfere with the natural progression of birth. 
					EFT is a simple, effective way to release any emotions or issues that are 
					troubling you.
					<br/><br/>
					I teach EFT to all my pregnant clients and have seen amazing things 
					happen. One client went into labor the day after her due date, 15 minutes 
					after she did EFT to release her previously unconscious ambivalence about 
					having another baby. Another client's baby moved from breech (head-up and 
					a common cause of C-sections) to vertex (head-down, ready for birth) after 
					she did a guided imagery session and used EFT to release emotional issues 
					that were causing tension in her abdomen. Yet another client used EFT to 
					release body memories of pain during her first baby's birth, and went on 
					to have a peaceful, comfortable labor with her second baby.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						5. Learn to relax.
					</h3>
					Dr. Grantley Dick-Read, an English doctor during the 1930s, coined the 
					term "fear-tension-pain syndrome." What this means is that women in labor 
					can become afraid: of pain, hospitals, that something will be wrong with 
					the baby, etc. Fear triggers the fight-or-flight stress response, which 
					makes the body think it is under attack. This slows down labor so the 
					woman can fight off or run away from the threat. After she gets safe 
					again, the relaxation response takes over and labor resumes.
					<br/><br/>
					However, fear during birthing is not usually stimulated by an actual 
					physical danger, but by internal anxiety such as the sight of needles or 
					the thought of a painful labor. The fight-or-flight response creates 
					tension in the body, which creates pain as the woman tries to continue 
					with labor despite the tension. The pain creates more fear, which creates 
					more tension, more pain ... and on and on.
					<br/><br/>
					I have coined my own term for what can happen when a laboring mother is 
					completely relaxed: I call it the "joy-peace-relaxation syndrome." I have 
					seen women give birth with joy and peace. I have heard from clients that 
					they are on cloud nine after delivering their babies in this beautiful way. 
					Not only is this possible, it is the way birth is supposed to be. Women 
					routinely ask, "But will I be able to do it?" as if natural, comfortable 
					birthing requires some special skill or talent that they lack. My answer 
					is always, "If you believe you can do it, you can do it."
					<br/><br/>
					What's the best way to learn how to relax? My favorite is HypnoBirthing&reg;, 
					a class that is designed to teach a woman to relax so deeply that her 
					body is completely limp and calm during labor. I have seen mothers in 
					labor who are so peaceful while birthing, they look like they’re asleep.
					<br/><br/>
					Yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and other relaxation methods are 
					wonderful for teaching the body to remain calm. But I recommend 
					HypnoBirthing® even for women who have experience with these methods, 
					because the class deals specifically with relaxation during labor, which 
					requires practice and focus that is not taught in general relaxation 
					classes.
					<h4>
						According to the HypnoBirthing&reg; Institute, the following are some 
						benefits of relaxed birthing:
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A safer birthing for mother and baby
						</li>
						<li>
							More comfortable birthing and possibly a shorter labor
						</li>
						<li>
							Reduced need for medication
						</li>
						<li>
							Fewer breech presentations
						</li>
						<li>
							Fewer complications and easier resolution in the event of 
							complication
						</li>
						<li>
							An awake, refreshed, and energized birthing mother
						</li>
						<li>
							A calm, peaceful birthing environment
						</li>
						<li>
							Good-natured babies who are better sleepers and eaters
						</li>
						<li>
							Happy parents who experience a serene, joyful birthing rather 
							than a tense, stressful ordeal
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>
						6. Watch Your Language
					</h3>
					Language is a tricky thing. On the one hand, society assigns clear 
					meanings to words so people can communicate with each other. Words appear 
					to be well defined and unambiguous. On the other hand, many words have a 
					subtle emotional connotation that escapes the conscious awareness.
					<br/><br/>
					Think about the word "contraction." Everybody understands that this is the 
					action performed by uterine muscles during labor. But what about the 
					underlying emotional meaning? Say the word out loud several times. As you 
					say it, contract your shoulders and chest. Feel the effect in your body. 
					Contraction holds the energy of fear and withdrawal. This is the subtle 
					emotional content of the word. It affects you and your baby every time you 
					hear it or say it, whether or not you are aware of the effect. Is this the 
					kind of energy you want your baby to feel during birth?
					<br/><br/>
					All words have the potential to affect people on a subconscious level. 
					Words that are harsh or disrespectful convey an unloving approach to birth. 
					Rather than contractions, pain, mucous plug, and catching the baby, why not 
					speak of uterine surges, comfort level, uterine seal, and receiving the 
					baby? Instead of Braxton-Hicks (how did two guys get their names in 
					women's bodies, anyway?) why not speak of "prelabor warm-ups"?
					<br/><br/>
					Be aware that the more you repeat words or thoughts, the greater the 
					effect on your body and subconscious mind. If you think or speak 
					constantly of your fear that you might need a C-section, you may be 
					setting up a subconscious expectation that you WILL need a C-section. 
					Do not judge yourself if you have been creating this type of negative 
					affirmation: simply reread #4 above: acknowledge your emotions, release 
					them, and repeat positive affirmations that create an expectation of a 
					beautiful, peaceful birth.
					<br/><br/>
					Practice using gentle words and positive affirmations. Notice the 
					difference in your mind and body. You'll like the change!
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						7. Exercise
					</h3>
					Moderate exercise is healthy for pregnant women and their babies. 
					According to this 
					<a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2001/03/21/babies-exercise.aspx" target="_blank">article</a>
					, pregnant women who exercised three or four times a week seemed to have 
					the best chance of having a healthy weight baby. The investigators found 
					that doing strenuous exercise such as aerobics more than four times a week 
					increased the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby. Low birth weight 
					increases the chance of future health problems for babies. So don't overdo 
					it. If you are a long-distance runner or like hard workouts at the gym, 
					slow down during pregnancy and consider walking, swimming, and light 
					weights.
					<br/><br/>
					Interestingly, staying sedentary also seems to increase the risk of 
					delivering a low birth weight baby. So don't be a couch potato. If you 
					haven't exercised before your pregnancy, get a good pair of shoes and 
					start walking. Start with 15 to 20 minutes and work up to 30 to 45 
					minutes. Walk at least three to four times weekly. Your baby will love you 
					for it.
					<br/><br/>
					If you're interested in learning a form of exercise that may directly 
					benefit you during labor, take belly dancing lessons. According to the 
					doulas I know, belly dancing originated as a way for women to strengthen 
					their abdominal muscles for birth. I heard a story recently about a woman 
					who went to the hospital, belly danced her way through labor, then 
					squatted down and had her baby. Just like that.
                </p>
                <p>
					<h3>
						8. Trust!
					</h3>
					During one birth I attended, the mother reported that she felt a wave 
					of anxiety at the beginning of each surge. As she closed her eyes and 
					focused on her breathing, I quietly reminded her of the millions of strong 
					women who have gone before her, having their babies naturally and 
					peacefully. Later she brought her baby to a class to talk about her 
					experience, and she said, "When I started feeling nervous I simply rested 
					in the strength of all the women who have gone before me."
					<br/><br/>
					My suggestion merely reminded her of what she already knew deep in her 
					heart: childbirth is meant to be a beautiful, sacred experience. The 
					miracle of bringing new life into the world is just that--a miracle.
					<br/><br/>
					Women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. We could never have 
					survived as a species unless women's bodies were designed for birthing. 
					Spend time in meditation and prayer during pregnancy, contemplating this 
					awareness. Cultivate a peaceful and gentle attitude about your body, your 
					baby, and the mysterious unfolding of life within you. Open your heart to 
					the sacred nature of birthing. Take time to notice and appreciate the 
					order inherent in the natural world. You are blessed with the opportunity 
					to create new life. Open your heart and Be Blessed.
