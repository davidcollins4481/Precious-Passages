                <p>
                    Breastmilk is the natural first food for babies, it provides all the 
                    energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of 
                    life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a childâ€™s 
                    nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up 
                    to one-third during the second year of life. Breastmilk promotes 
                    sensory and cognitive development, and protects the infant against 
                    infectious and chronic diseases. Exclusive breastfeeding reduces 
                    infant mortality due to common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea 
                    or pneumonia, and helps for a quicker recovery during illness. These 
                    effects can be measured in  resource-poor and affluent societies 
                    (Kramer M et al  Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial 
                    (PROBIT): A randomized trial in the Republic of Belarus. Journal 
                    of the American Medical Association, 2001, 285 (4): 413-420)

                    While breastfeeding is a natural act, it is also a <b>learned behaviour</b>.  
                    An extensive body of research has demonstrated that  mothers and other 
                    caregivers require active support for establishing and sustaining 
                    appropriate breastfeeding practices. WHO and UNICEF launched the 
                    Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative in 1992, to strengthen maternity 
                    practices to support breastfeeding.
