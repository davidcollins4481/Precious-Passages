                   The following is a pictorial representation of cesarean section.

                   no pain.  Graphics courtesy of

                            Prior to the surgery, you will most likely be given an 
                            epidural for pain control.  Other options include a spinal 
                            or general anesthesia.

                            The initial incision is made through the skin and abdominal 
                            muscles.  The internal organs are exposed with retractors 
                            and the bladder is moved away from the surface of the uterus. 
                             A retractor is a metal instrument used to pull the skin and 
                             muscle open to allow the surgeon a clear view the surgical 
                             field.

                            The uterine incision is then made.  The top picture shows a 
                            low transverse incision, the bottom picture shows a classical 
                            midline incision.  Most cesarean sections are done using the 
                            transverse incision.  The vertical incision is reserved for 
                            emergency surgery.  After the incision is made, the uterus is 
                            retracted.

                            baby is breech).  When the surgeon has a grip on the baby, 
                            an assistant will press firmly on the top of your uterus to 
                            help deliver the baby.  You will likely feel some pressure 
                            while the baby is delivered, but should not feel pain.

                            The surgeon will clamp and cut the cord and the baby will 
                            be handed off to a nurse for evaluation.  The placenta and 
                            membranes will then be delivered.  After the surgeon is 
                            satisfied that the uterus has clamped down enough to prevent 
                            hemorrhage, he/she will repair the uterine, muscle and skin 
                            incisions.

                            A cesarean is major surgery.  The scar should be cared for by

                            to move in such a way that you stretch or stress the scar.  
                            You will be more comfortable holding and nursing your baby 
                            if you place a pillow over your scar to prevent direct
