                    Gestational Diabetes is an ever increasingly common complication 
                    during pregnancy.  In this situation, the best defense is a good 
                    offense.  By following a high protein well rounded diet, such as 
                    The Brewer Medical Diet for Normal and High-Risk Pregnancy, it is 
                    often possible to avoid the pitfalls of gestational diabetes and 
                    pre-ecclampsia.  This diet is not Atkins, it is not meant for 
                    weight loss.
