                    There are several different birthing methods.  Each style offers 
                    advantages and disadvantages as well as unique coping strategies.  
                    It is wise to become familiar with all of them and then choose one 
                    that you will learn about in depth, either through an instructor 
                    led class or by buying the text and teaching yourself.  A doula 
                    will be familiar with many different birthing methods and will be 
                    able to guide you in a choice that fits both your personality and 
                    your desired level of intervention/pain relief.  Please take the 
                    time to read about choosing a childbirth educator.  It is important 
                    to remember that an educator that is affiliated with a hospital will 
                    offer different information than an independent instructor  Hospital 
                    based educators are often restricted in the information they are 
                    allowed to offer by hospital policy.   This list is by no means 
                    inclusive, however, these are currently the most popular methods 
                    of childbirth preparation.
